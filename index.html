  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The Fund invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in Government securities, cash and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by Government securities or cash. For purposes of this policy,
    &#8220;Government securities&#8221; means any securities issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States, or by a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the Government of the United States pursuant to authority
    granted by the Congress of the United States; or any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing. The Fund intends to be a &#8220;Government money market fund,&#8221; as such term is defined in or interpreted under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of
    1940. Shareholders will be given at least 60 days&#8217; advance notice of any change to the 99.5% policy.</div>

  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The Fund uses the amortized cost method of valuation to seek to maintain a stable $1.00 share price and does not currently intend to impose liquidity fees or redemption gates on Fund redemptions. Please
    note, however, that the board of trustees reserves the ability to subject the Fund to a liquidity fee and/or redemption gate in the future, after providing prior notice to shareholders.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">Government agency or instrumentality issues have different levels of credit support. <font style="font-weight: bold;">U.S. government-sponsored entities (&#8220;GSEs&#8221;), such as Federal National Mortgage
      Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), may be chartered by Acts of Congress, but their securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. government. Although the U.S. government has provided
      financial support to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and certain other GSEs, no assurance can be given that the U.S. government will continue to do so.</font> Accordingly, securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may involve a risk of non-payment of
    principal and interest. Investors should remember that guarantees of timely repayment of principal and interest do not apply to the market prices and yields of the securities or to the net asset value or performance of the Fund, which will vary with
    changes in interest rates and other market conditions.</div>

  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Repurchase agreements</font> which are agreements by the Fund to buy Government securities and then to sell the securities back on an agreed upon date (generally, less

    dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of 60 calendar days or less, maintains a dollar-weighted average life for its portfolio of 120 calendar days or less, and only buys securities that mature in 397 calendar days or less.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Blockchain-based shares; no investment in cryptocurrencies&#160; </font>Although the Fund&#8217;s transfer agent will maintain the official record of share ownership in book-entry
    form, the ownership of the Fund&#8217;s shares will also be recorded on the Stellar network, an electronic distributed ledger that is secured using cryptography (referred to as a &#8220;blockchain&#8221;).&#160; A blockchain contains a digital record or ledger of transaction
    data that is permanently recorded in files called &#8220;blocks.&#8221; Blockchain networks are based upon software source code that establishes and governs their respective cryptographic systems for verifying transactions.&#160; The Fund will not invest in any
    cryptocurrencies (referred to as, among other things, virtual currencies).</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">At this time, shares of the Fund are not currently available for purchase, sale or transfer from one shareholder to another shareholder (or potential shareholder) (&#8220;peer-to-peer&#8221;) on the blockchain or
    in any secondary trading market.&#160; The Fund&#8217;s investment manager believes that blockchain-based shares will provide increased transparency to Fund shareholders and may, in the future, permit reduced settlement times and provide other benefits to Fund
    shareholders.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Principal Risks </div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not
    insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund&#8217;s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial
    support to the Fund at any time.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Interest Rate</font> &#160; When interest rates rise, debt security prices generally fall. The opposite is also generally true: debt security prices rise when interest rates
    fall. Interest rate changes are influenced by a number of factors including government policy, monetary policy, inflation expectations, perceptions of risk, and supply and demand of debt securities. In general, securities with longer maturities or
    durations are more sensitive to these interest rate changes. The Fund&#8217;s yield will vary. A sharp and unexpected rise in interest rates could cause the Fund&#8217;s share price to drop below a dollar. A low interest rate environment may prevent the Fund from
    providing a positive yield or paying Fund expenses out of current income and could impair the Fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable net asset value.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Credit</font> &#160; U.S. government investments generally have the least credit risk but are not completely free of credit risk. The Fund may incur losses on debt securities
    that are inaccurately perceived to present a different amount of credit risk by the market, the investment manager or the rating</div>

  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">agencies than such securities actually do. Any downgrade of securities issued by the U.S. government may result in a downgrade of securities issued by its agencies or instrumentalities.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Income</font> &#160; Because the Fund can only distribute what it earns, the Fund&#8217;s distributions to shareholders may decline when prevailing interest rates fall. Because the
    Fund limits its investments to high-quality, short-term securities, its portfolio generally will earn lower yields than a portfolio with lower-quality, longer-term securities subject to more risk.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">U.S. Government Securities</font> &#160; Not all obligations of the U.S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities are backed by the full faith and credit of the United
    States. Some obligations are backed only by the credit of the issuing agency or instrumentality, and in some cases there may be some risk of default by the issuer. Any guarantee by the U.S. Government or its agencies or instrumentalities of a security
    held by the Fund does not apply to the market value of such security or to shares of the Fund itself. A security backed by the U.S. Treasury or the full faith and credit of the United States is guaranteed only as to the timely payment of interest and
    principal when held to maturity.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Repurchase Agreements</font> &#160; A repurchase agreement exposes the Fund to the risk that the party that sells the securities to the Fund may default on its obligation to
    repurchase them.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Market</font> &#160; The market values of securities or other investments owned by the Fund will go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. The market value of a
    security or other investment may be reduced by market activity or other results of supply and demand unrelated to the issuer. This is a basic risk associated with all investments. When there are more sellers than buyers, prices tend to fall. Likewise,
    when there are more buyers than sellers, prices tend to rise.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Management</font> &#160; The Fund is subject to management risk because it is exposed to an actively managed investment portfolio. The investment manager applies investment
    techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the Fund, but there can be no guarantee that these decisions will produce the desired results.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Blockchain-Based Shares</font> &#160; Although the Fund&#8217;s transfer agent will maintain the official record of share ownership in book-entry form, the ownership of the Fund&#8217;s
    shares will also be recorded on the blockchain. Transactions on the blockchain are verified and authenticated by computers on the network (referred to as &#8220;nodes&#8221; or &#8220;network validators&#8221;) that receive, propagate, verify, and execute transactions.&#160; The
    process of authenticating a transaction before it is recorded ensures that only valid and authorized transactions are permanently recorded on the blockchain. However, in the event of a conflict between the blockchain record and the record held by the
    transfer agent, the transfer agent&#8217;s record will be determinative. A discrepancy between the blockchain record and the official record of share ownership could result in a delay of the processing of a purchase and redemption order. The use of
    distributed ledger technology is untested for mutual funds.</div>

  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">Because the Fund is new, it has no performance history. Once the Fund has commenced operations, you can obtain updated performance information by calling (800) DIAL BEN/342-5236 or accessing the
    information through the [ ] application (App) (discussed below) or at XFTXFT.com.</div>

  <div style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold;">Fund Details</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Investment Goal</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The Fund&#8217;s investment goal is to provide investors with as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of shareholders&#8217; capital and liquidity. The Fund also tries to maintain a
    stable $1.00 share price.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Principal Investment Policies and Practices </div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The Fund invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in Government securities, cash and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by Government securities or cash. In addition, under normal
    circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in Government securities and repurchase agreements collateralized fully by Government securities. In contrast to the Fund&#8217;s 99.5% policy, the Fund&#8217;s 80% policy does not include cash. For
    purposes of these policies, &#8220;Government securities&#8221; means any securities issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the United States, or by a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the Government of the United
    States pursuant to authority granted by the Congress of the United States; or any certificate of deposit for any of the foregoing. The Fund intends to be a &#8220;Government money market fund,&#8221; as such term is defined in or interpreted under Rule 2a-7 under
    the Investment Company Act of 1940. Shareholders will be given at least 60 days&#8217; advance notice of any change to the 99.5% and 80% policies.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The Fund uses the amortized cost method of valuation to seek to maintain a stable $1.00 share price and does not currently intend to impose liquidity fees or redemption gates on Fund redemptions. Please
    note, however, that the board of trustees reserves the ability to subject the Fund to a liquidity fee and/or redemption gate in the future, after providing prior notice to shareholders.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">Government agency or instrumentality issues have different levels of credit support. <font style="font-weight: bold;">U.S. government-sponsored entities (&#8220;GSEs&#8221;), such as Federal National Mortgage
      Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), may be chartered by Acts of Congress, but their securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. government. Although the U.S. government has provided
      financial support to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and certain other GSEs, no assurance can be given that the U.S. government will continue to do so.</font> Accordingly, securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may involve a risk of non-payment of
    principal and interest. Investors should remember that guarantees of timely repayment of principal and interest do not apply to the market prices and yields of the securities or to the net asset value or performance of the Fund, which will vary with
    changes in interest rates and other market conditions.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The Fund invests in:</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">U.S. government securities</font> which may include fixed, floating and variable rate securities.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Repurchase agreements</font> which are agreements by the Fund to buy Government securities and then to sell the securities back on an agreed upon date (generally, less
    than seven days) at a higher price, which reflects prevailing short-term interest rates.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Portfolio maturity and quality</font>&#160;&#160; The Fund only buys securities that the investment manager determines present minimal credit risks. The Fund maintains a
    dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity of 60 calendar days or less, maintains a dollar-weighted average life for its portfolio of 120 calendar days or less, and only buys securities that mature in 397 calendar days or less.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Blockchain-based shares; no investment in cryptocurrencies </font>Although the Fund&#8217;s transfer agent will maintain the official record of share ownership in book-entry
    form, the ownership of the Fund&#8217;s shares will also be recorded on the Stellar network, an electronic distributed ledger that is secured using cryptography (referred to as a &#8220;blockchain&#8221;).&#160; A blockchain contains a digital record or ledger of transaction
    data that is permanently recorded in files called &#8220;blocks.&#8221; Blockchain networks are based upon software source code that establishes and governs their respective cryptographic systems for verifying transactions.&#160; In the future, the ownership of the

  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">In traditional blockchain networks, copies of the blockchain ledger are stored in a decentralized manner on computers across a peer-to-peer network. Users of the blockchain network maintain a copy of
    the ledger with all copies of the ledger synchronized through a consensus algorithm. Protocols included in the source code govern the rules, operations and communications of the underlying blockchain network, including the validation of new blocks that
    contain an updated ledger reflecting new transactions.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">At this time, investors may only purchase or redeem shares of the Fund directly through the App, which is available for download through the Apple App Store and Google Play, and shares are not currently
    available for purchase, sale or transfer from one shareholder to another shareholder (or potential shareholder) (&#8220;peer-to-peer&#8221;) on the blockchain or in any secondary trading market (such as an electronic trading platform that is registered with the
    SEC as an alternative trading system).&#160; The Fund&#8217;s investment manager believes that blockchain-based shares will provide increased transparency to Fund shareholders and may, in the future, permit reduced settlement times and provide other benefits to
    Fund shareholders.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Temporary Investments</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">When the investment manager believes market or economic conditions are unusual or unfavorable for investors, the investment manager may invest up to 100% of the Fund&#8217;s assets in a temporary defensive
    manner by holding all or a substantial portion of its assets in cash. The investment manager may also hold cash when securities meeting the Fund&#8217;s investment criteria are unavailable or to maintain liquidity. In these circumstances, the Fund may be
    unable to achieve its investment goal.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Principal Risks</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Interest Rate</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">Interest rate changes can be sudden and unpredictable, and are influenced by a number of factors including government policy, monetary policy, inflation expectations, perceptions of risk, and supply and
    demand of debt securities. Changes in government or central bank monetary policy, including changes in tax policy or changes in a central bank&#8217;s implementation of specific policy goals, may have a substantial impact on interest rates. There can be no
    guarantee that any particular government or central bank policy will be continued, discontinued or changed or that any such policy will have the desired effect on interest rates. Debt securities generally tend to lose market value when interest rates
    rise and increase in value when interest rates fall. A rise in interest rates also has the potential to cause investors to rapidly move out of fixed-income securities. A substantial increase in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on the
    liquidity of a security, especially those with longer maturities or durations. Securities with longer maturities or durations or lower coupons or that make little (or no) interest payments before maturity tend to be more sensitive to these interest
    rate changes.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The Fund&#8217;s yield will vary; it is not fixed for a specific period like the yield on a bank certificate of deposit. A sharp and unexpected rise in interest rates could cause the Fund&#8217;s share price to
    drop below a dollar. However, the short maturities of the securities held in the Fund&#8217;s portfolio reduce their potential for price fluctuation. A low interest rate environment may prevent the Fund from providing a positive yield or paying Fund expenses
    out of current income and could impair the Fund&#8217;s ability to maintain a stable net asset value.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Credit</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">U.S. government investments generally have the least credit risk but are not completely free of credit risk. The Fund may incur losses on debt securities that are inaccurately perceived to present a
    different amount of credit risk by the market, the investment manager or the rating agencies than such securities actually do. Any downgrade of securities issued by the U.S. government may result in a downgrade of securities issued by its agencies or
    instrumentalities.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Income</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The Fund&#8217;s distributions to shareholders may decline when prevailing interest rates fall, when the Fund experiences defaults on debt securities it holds or when the Fund realizes a loss upon the sale of
    a debt security. The Fund&#8217;s income generally declines during periods of falling</div>

    Because the Fund limits its investments to high-quality, short-term securities, its portfolio generally will earn lower yields than a portfolio with lower-quality, longer-term securities subject to more risk.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">U.S. Government Securities</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">Not all obligations of the U.S. Government, its agencies and instrumentalities are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Some obligations are backed only by the credit of the issuing
    agency or instrumentality, and in some cases there may be some risk of default by the issuer. Any guarantee by the U.S. Government or its agencies or instrumentalities of a security held by the Fund does not apply to the market value of such security
    or to shares of the Fund itself. A security backed by the U.S. Treasury or the full faith and credit of the United States is guaranteed only as to the timely payment of interest and principal when held to maturity.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Repurchase Agreements</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">A repurchase agreement exposes the Fund to the risk that the party that sells the securities to the Fund may default on its obligation to repurchase them.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Market</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The market values of securities or other investments owned by the Fund will go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Securities or other investments may decline in value due to factors
    affecting individual issuers, markets generally or sectors within the markets. The value of a security or other investment may go up or down due to general market conditions which are not specifically related to a particular issuer, such as real or
    perceived adverse economic conditions, changes in interest rates or exchange rates, or adverse investor sentiment generally. The value may also go up or down due to factors that affect an individual issuer or a particular sector. During a general
    downturn in the securities markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that securities or other investments held by the Fund will participate in or otherwise benefit from the advance.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Management</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The Fund is exposed to an actively managed investment portfolio and could experience losses (realized and unrealized) if the investment manager&#8217;s judgment about markets, interest rates or the
    attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the Fund prove to be incorrect. There can be no guarantee that these techniques or the investment manager&#8217;s investment decisions will produce the
    desired results. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may affect the investment techniques available to the investment manager in connection with managing the Fund and may also adversely affect the ability of the Fund to achieve
    its investment goal.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Blockchain-Based Shares</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">Although the Fund&#8217;s transfer agent will maintain the official record of share ownership in book-entry form, the ownership of the Fund&#8217;s shares will also be recorded on the Stellar network. Transactions
    on the blockchain are verified and authenticated by computers on the network (referred to as &#8220;nodes&#8221; or &#8220;network validators&#8221;) that receive, propagate, verify, and execute transactions.&#160; Users of the Stellar network must pay transaction fees (in the
    form of &#8220;Stellar Lumens,&#8221; the native digital asset for the operation of Stellar) to the Stellar network in order to validate a transaction. Such transaction fees are intended to protect the Stellar ledger from frivolous or malicious computational
    tasks. These transaction fees will be the responsibility of the investment manager or its affiliates or a third party.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The process of authenticating a transaction before it is recorded ensures that only valid and authorized transactions are permanently recorded on the blockchain. However, in the event of a conflict
    between the blockchain record and the record held by the transfer agent, the transfer agent&#8217;s record will be determinative. A discrepancy between the blockchain record and the official record of share ownership could result in a delay of the processing
    of a purchase and redemption order. The use of distributed ledger technology is untested for mutual funds.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">Upon the creation of an account through the App, a blockchain wallet and a corresponding public and private key pair will be created for each investor. A key pair consists of a public key and its

    to a recipient&#8217;s wallet address.&#160; Only the holder of the private key associated with a particular wallet address can digitally sign a transaction proposing a transfer of the digital asset from that particular wallet address. Investors will be provided
    with the public key for their wallets, and they will be able to track the balance of any Fund shares in their wallets through the App as well as on a public &#8220;block explorer&#8221; tool capable of displaying activity on the Stellar network. A third party
    digital asset custodian will be responsible for custody of the private keys associated with each shareholder&#8217;s shares.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">In the future, the ownership of the Fund&#8217;s shares may be maintained and recorded solely on the Stellar network, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. There are risks associated with the

  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">Delays in transaction processing have occurred on the Stellar network.&#160; Such a delay may occur on account of, among other things, the inability of nodes to reach consensus on transactions.&#160; During a
    network delay, it will not be possible to record transactions in the shares on the blockchain. Should such a delay occur for an extended period of time, the Fund could choose to effect transactions with shareholders manually (i.e., in book-entry form)
    until such time as the network has resumed normal operation. The Fund may choose to reevaluate the suitability of the Stellar network for the Fund&#8217;s shares in the event of future or recurring delays.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">Furthermore, copies of the Stellar ledger will be available to the public and will store the complete transaction history from issuance of the shares. As a result, robust and transparent data, other
    than shareholder personal identifying information, will be publicly available via block explorers. The shares&#8217; issuance and redemption data will be secured by cryptography and only a public-key-derived wallet address (and not a shareholder&#8217;s personal
    identifying information) will be exposed to the public. The personal identifying information necessary to associate a public key representing a given share with the record owner of that share will be maintained by [ ] and the Fund&#8217;s transfer agent in a
    separate database that is not available to the public. However, if there are data security breaches with respect to [ ]&#8217;s or the transfer agent&#8217;s database resulting in theft of the information necessary to link personal identity with public keys, the
    stolen information could be used to determine a shareholder&#8217;s identity and complete investing history in the Fund.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">Although the investment manager has experience managing mutual funds and risk oversight, it has limited experience in the blockchain technology industry. On account of these risks, the Fund may never
    achieve market acceptance and may not be able to attract sizable assets or achieve scale.&#160; Under these circumstances, the investment manager and the Fund&#8217;s board of trustees may take actions including, potentially, restructuring or liquidating the

    assets, and have been in the investment management business since 1947.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The Fund pays Advisers a fee for managing the Fund&#8217;s assets. The fee is equal to an annual rate of [ ]% of the average daily net assets of the Fund.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">In efforts to prevent a negative yield, management (i.e., the investment manager and certain of its affiliates) may voluntarily agree to waive or limit its fees, assume as its own expense certain
    expenses otherwise payable by the Fund, and if necessary, make a capital infusion into the Fund. These waivers, expense reimbursements and capital infusions would be voluntary and may be modified or discontinued by management at any time and without
    further notice. There is no guarantee that the Fund will be able to avoid a negative yield.</div>

  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The investment manager and the Fund have received an exemptive order from the SEC that allows the Fund to operate in a &#8220;manager of managers&#8221; structure whereby the investment manager can appoint and
    replace both wholly-owned and unaffiliated sub-advisors, and enter into, amend and terminate sub-advisory agreements with such sub-advisors, each subject to board approval but without obtaining prior shareholder approval (Manager of Managers
    Structure). The investment manager does not currently utilize a sub-advisor with respect to the Fund.&#160; The Fund will, however, inform shareholders of the hiring of any sub-advisor within 90 days after the hiring. The SEC exemptive order provides the
    Fund with greater flexibility and efficiency by preventing the Fund from incurring the expense and delays associated with obtaining shareholder approval of such sub-advisory agreements.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The use of the Manager of Managers Structure with respect to the Fund is subject to certain conditions that are set forth in the SEC exemptive order. Under the Manager of Managers Structure, the
    investment manager has the ultimate responsibility, subject to oversight by the Fund&#8217;s board of trustees, to oversee sub-advisors and recommend their hiring, termination and replacement. The investment manager will also, subject to the review and
    approval of the Fund&#8217;s board of trustees: set the Fund&#8217;s overall investment strategy; evaluate, select and recommend sub-advisors to manage all or a portion of the Fund&#8217;s assets; and implement procedures reasonably designed to ensure that each
    sub-advisor complies with the Fund&#8217;s investment goal, policies and restrictions. Subject to review by the Fund&#8217;s board of trustees, the investment manager will allocate and, when appropriate, reallocate the Fund&#8217;s assets among sub-advisors and monitor
    and evaluate the sub-advisors&#8217; performance.</div>

  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Income and Capital Gain Distributions</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">As a regulated investment company, the Fund generally pays no federal income tax on the income and gains it distributes to you. The Fund intends to declare income dividends from its net investment
    income each day that its net asset value (NAV) is calculated. Your account (via the App) begins to receive dividends on the day after the Fund receives your investment and continues to receive dividends through the day it receives a request to sell
    your shares. Capital gains, if any, may be paid at least annually. The Fund may distribute income dividends and capital gains more frequently, if necessary, in order to reduce or eliminate federal excise or income taxes on the Fund. The amount of any
    distribution will vary, and there is no guarantee the Fund will pay either income dividends or capital gain distributions. Your income dividends and capital gain distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares at NAV on the payable
    date, which has the effect of compounding of dividends.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Annual statements.</font> &#160; After the close of each calendar year, you will receive tax information from the Fund with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the
    Fund&#8217;s distributions occurring during the prior calendar year. If the Fund finds it necessary to reclassify its distributions after you receive your tax information, the Fund will send you revised tax information. Distributions declared in December to
    shareholders of record in such month and paid in January are taxable as if they were paid in December. Additional tax information about the Fund&#8217;s distributions will be available through the App or online at XFTXFT.com.</div>

  </div>
  <div><br>
  </div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">Fund distributions are generally taxable to you as ordinary income. This is the case even if you reinvest your distributions in additional Fund shares. It is not anticipated that the Fund will be
    available to tax-deferred investors.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Dividend income.</font> &#160; Income dividends are generally subject to tax at ordinary rates. Because the Fund invests primarily in debt securities, it is expected that
    none of the Fund&#8217;s income dividends will be qualified dividends subject to reduced rates of taxation to individuals. A return-of-capital distribution is generally not taxable but will reduce the cost basis of your shares, and will result in a higher
    capital gain or a lower capital loss when you later sell your shares.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Capital gains.</font> &#160; Fund distributions of short-term capital gains are also subject to tax at ordinary rates. Because the Fund is a money market fund, it does not
    expect to realize and distribute any long-term capital gains on its investments.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Sales of Fund shares.</font> &#160; Because the Fund seeks to maintain a $1.00 per share NAV, sales of its shares will not generally result in a taxable capital gain or loss
    for federal or state income tax purposes.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Medicare tax.</font> &#160; An additional 3.8% Medicare tax is imposed on certain net investment income (including ordinary dividends and capital gain distributions received
    from the Fund and net gains from redemptions or other taxable dispositions of Fund shares) of U.S. individuals, estates and trusts to the extent that such person&#8217;s &#8220;modified adjusted gross income&#8221; (in the case of an individual) or &#8220;adjusted gross
    income&#8221; (in the case of an estate or trust) exceeds a threshold amount. Any liability for this additional Medicare tax is reported on, and paid with, your federal income tax return.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Backup withholding.</font> &#160; A shareholder may be subject to backup withholding on any distributions of income and capital gains if the shareholder has provided either
    an incorrect tax identification number or no number at all, is subject to backup withholding by the IRS for failure to properly report payments of interest or dividends, has failed to certify that the shareholder is not subject to backup withholding,
    or has not certified that the shareholder is a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). The backup withholding rate is currently 24%. State backup withholding may also apply.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">State and local taxes.</font> &#160; Distributions of ordinary income and capital gains, if any, are generally subject to state and local taxes. However distributions of
    ordinary income paid to individual shareholders from interest earned by the Fund on certain U.S. Government obligations may be exempt from state and local income taxation depending on the state. Shareholders should contact their tax advisors with
    respect to the state and local income tax consequences of investing in the Fund, including whether Fund dividends derived from interest on U.S. government obligations held by the Fund qualify for tax free treatment.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Non-U.S. investors.</font> &#160; Non-U.S. investors may be subject to U.S. withholding tax at 30% or a lower treaty rate on Fund dividends of ordinary income. Non-U.S.
    investors may be subject to U.S. estate tax on the value of their shares. They are subject to special U.S. tax certification requirements to avoid backup withholding, claim any exemptions from withholding and claim any treaty benefits. Exemptions from
    U.S. withholding tax are generally provided for capital gains realized on the sale of Fund shares, capital gain dividends paid by the Fund from net long-term capital gains, short-term capital gain dividends paid by the Fund from net short-term capital
    gains and interest-related dividends paid by the Fund from its qualified net interest income from U.S. sources. However, notwithstanding such exemptions from U.S. withholding tax at source, any such dividends and distributions of income and capital
    gains will be subject to backup withholding at a rate of 24% if you fail to properly certify that you are not a U.S. person.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Other reporting and withholding requirements.</font> &#160; Payments to a shareholder that is either a foreign financial institution or a non-financial foreign entity within
    the meaning of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) may be subject to a 30% withholding tax on income dividends, certain capital gain distributions, return-of-capital distributions and the gross proceeds from the redemption of Fund shares.
    The FATCA withholding tax generally can be avoided by such foreign entity if it provides the Fund, and in some cases, the IRS, information concerning the ownership of certain foreign financial accounts or other appropriate certifications or
    documentation concerning its status under FATCA. The Fund may be required to report certain shareholder account information to the IRS, non-U.S. taxing authorities or other parties to comply with FATCA.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Other tax information.</font> &#160; This discussion of &#8220;Distributions and Taxes&#8221; is for general information only and is not tax advice. You should consult your own tax
    advisor regarding your particular circumstances, and about any federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences before making an investment in the Fund. Additional information about the tax consequences of investing in the Fund may be found in the

    need to link one of your bank accounts to your App account so that you may use electronic funds transfer to and from your bank account to buy and sell shares. The App will keep your bank information on file for future purchases and redemptions. The App
    does not accept cash, credit card convenience checks, non-bank money orders, travelers checks or checks drawn on foreign banks as forms of payment to purchase shares.</div>

  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The Fund&#8217;s board of trustees has adopted the following policies and procedures with respect to frequent trading in Fund shares (Frequent Trading Policy).</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The Fund does not intend to accommodate short-term or frequent purchases and redemptions of Fund shares that may be detrimental to the Fund. For example, this type of trading activity could interfere
    with the efficient management of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio or materially increase the Fund&#8217;s transaction costs, administrative costs or taxes.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">Through its transfer agent and the Stellar network, the Fund performs ongoing monitoring of shareholder trading in shares of the Fund and other X Financial Technologies funds in order to try and identify
    shareholder trading patterns that suggest an ongoing short-term trading strategy. If shareholder trading patterns identified by the transfer agent and/or the Stellar network through monitoring or from other information regarding</div>

  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">the shareholder&#8217;s trading activity in non-X Financial Technologies funds leads the transfer agent to reasonably conclude that such trading may be detrimental to the Fund as described in this Frequent Trading
    Policy, the transfer agent, on behalf of the Fund, may temporarily or permanently bar future purchases into the Fund or, alternatively, may limit the amount, number or frequency of any future purchases and/or the method by which you may request future
    purchases and redemptions.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">In considering an investor&#8217;s trading patterns, the Fund may consider, among other factors, the investor&#8217;s trading history in the Fund, in other X Financial Technologies funds, in non-X Financial Technologies mutual
    funds, or in accounts under common control or ownership (see, for example, &#8220;Buying and Selling Shares - Investment by large shareholders&#8221; in the SAI). The transfer agent may also reject any purchase or redemption request, whether or not it represents
    part of any ongoing trading pattern, if the Fund&#8217;s investment manager or transfer agent reasonably concludes that the amount of the requested transaction may disrupt or otherwise interfere with the efficient management of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio. In
    determining what actions should be taken, the Fund&#8217;s transfer agent may consider a variety of factors, including the potential impact of such remedial actions on the Fund and its shareholders.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Revocation of trades.</font> &#160; While the Fund reserves the right to reject any purchase order for any reason, the Fund may also revoke executed purchase orders that the

  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">When you buy shares, you pay the NAV per share. When you sell shares, you receive the NAV.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The Fund calculates the NAV per share each business day as of 1 p.m. Pacific time or the regularly scheduled close of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), whichever is earlier. The Fund does not
    calculate the NAV on days the NYSE is closed for trading, which include New Year&#8217;s Day, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, President&#8217;s Day, Good Friday, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. If the NYSE has a scheduled
    early close, the Fund&#8217;s share price would be determined as of the time of the close of the NYSE. If, due to weather or other special or unexpected circumstances, the NYSE has an unscheduled early close on a day that it has opened for business, the Fund
    reserves the right to consider that day as a regular business day and accept purchase and redemption orders and calculate its share price as of the normally scheduled close of regular trading on the NYSE. The Fund&#8217;s NAV per share is readily available
    through the App and online at XFTXFT.com.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The Fund&#8217;s assets are generally valued at their amortized cost.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">Requests to buy and sell shares are processed at the NAV next calculated after we receive your request in proper form through the App.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Redemptions</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">Typically, the Fund uses cash and cash equivalents held in its portfolio or sells portfolio assets to meet all redemption needs. In unusual circumstances or under stressed market conditions, the Fund
    may use other methods to meet redemptions, such as the use of lines of credit or interfund lending in reliance on exemptive relief from the SEC.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Redemptions in Kind</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The Fund reserves the right to make payments in whole or in part in securities or other assets of the Fund. You should expect to incur transaction costs upon the disposition of the securities received
    in the distribution. In addition, you will bear the market risk of the securities you hold until the securities are sold.</div>
  <div style="margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; font-size: 12pt; font-weight: bold;">Statements, Reports and Prospectuses</div>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The following information provided with respect to the Fund is in addition to that included in the Fund&#8217;s prospectus.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">In addition to the main types of investments and strategies undertaken by the Fund as described in the prospectus, the Fund also may invest in other types of instruments and engage in and pursue other investment
      strategies, which are described in this SAI. Investments and investment strategies with respect to the Fund are discussed in greater detail in the section below entitled <font style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;Glossary of Investments, Techniques,
        Strategies and Their Risks.&#8221;</font></div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Generally, the policies and restrictions discussed in this SAI and in the prospectus apply when the Fund makes an investment. In most cases, the Fund is not required to sell an investment because circumstances change
      and the investment no longer meets one or more of the Fund&#8217;s policies or restrictions. If a percentage restriction or limitation is met at the time of investment, a later increase or decrease in the percentage due to a change in the value or
      liquidity of portfolio investments will not be considered a violation of the restriction or limitation, with the exception of the Fund&#8217;s limitations on borrowing as described herein or unless otherwise noted herein.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund has adopted certain investment restrictions as fundamental and non-fundamental policies. A fundamental policy may only be changed if the change is approved by (i) more than 50% of the Fund&#8217;s outstanding shares
      or (ii) 67% or more of the Fund&#8217;s shares present at a shareholder meeting if more than 50% of the Fund&#8217;s outstanding shares are represented at the meeting in person or by proxy, whichever is less. A non-fundamental policy may be changed without the
      approval of shareholders.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the Fund is not insured by the
      Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, or any other agency of the U.S. government. The Fund&#8217;s sponsor has no legal obligation to provide financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide
      financial support to the Fund at any time. Shares of the Fund are not deposits or obligations of, or guaranteed or endorsed by, any bank.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">For more information about the restrictions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) on the Fund with respect to borrowing and senior securities, see <font style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;Glossary of Investments,
        Techniques, Strategies and Their Risks- </font>Borrowing&#8221; below.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt; font-style: italic;">Fundamental Investment Policies</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund&#8217;s investment goal is to provide investors with as high a level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of shareholders&#8217; capital and liquidity. The Fund also tries to maintain a stable $1.00
      share price. In all cases, the Fund may pursue its policies by investing in another registered investment company with the same investment goal and substantially similar policies and restrictions as the Fund.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund may not:</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">1.&#160; Borrow money, except to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, or any rules, exemptions or interpretations thereunder that may be adopted, granted or issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">2.&#160; Act as an underwriter except to the extent the Fund may be deemed to be an underwriter when disposing of securities it owns or when selling its own shares.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">3.&#160; Make loans if, as a result, more than 331/3% of its total assets would be lent to other persons, including other investment companies to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act or any rules, exemptions or
      interpretations thereunder that may be adopted, granted or issued by the SEC. This limitation does not apply to (i) the lending of portfolio securities, (ii) the purchase of debt securities, other debt instruments, loan participations and/or engaging
      in direct corporate loans in accordance with its investment goals and policies, and (iii) repurchase agreements to the extent the entry into a repurchase agreement is deemed to be a loan.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">4.&#160; Purchase or sell real estate unless acquired as a result of ownership of securities or other instruments and provided that this restriction does not prevent the Fund from (i) purchasing or selling securities or
      instruments secured by real estate or interests therein, securities or instruments representing interests in real estate or securities or instruments of issuers that invest, deal or otherwise engage in transactions in real estate or interests
      therein, and (ii) making, purchasing or selling real estate mortgage loans.</div>

      the Fund, except that up to 25% of the value of its total assets may be invested without regard to such 5% and 10% limitations.<sup style="vertical-align: text-top; line-height: 1; font-size: smaller;">1</sup></div>

      limitations unless specifically stated as such in the Fund&#8217;s prospectus or elsewhere in this SAI.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund may invest in securities that are rated by various rating agencies such as Moody&#8217;s Investors Service (Moody&#8217;s) and Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s Financial Services (S&amp;P&#174;), as well as securities that are unrated.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The following are requirements for money market fund investments, and securities and techniques used by the Fund:</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Liquidity</font>&#160; The Fund may not invest more than 5% of its total assets (measured at the time of acquisition) in illiquid securities, as defined under applicable regulation.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund is required to invest at least 10% of its total assets (measured at the time of acquisition) in &#8220;daily liquid assets&#8221; and at least 30% of its total assets (measured at the time of acquisition) in &#8220;weekly liquid
      assets.&#8221; &#8220;Daily liquid assets&#8221; are cash (including demand deposits), direct obligations of the U.S. Government, securities (including repurchase agreements) that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is exercisable and payable within
      one business day or amounts receivable and due unconditionally within one business day on pending sales of portfolio securities. &#8220;Weekly liquid assets&#8221; are cash (including demand deposits), direct obligations of the U.S. Government, U.S. Government
      agency/instrumentality discount notes (without provision for the payment of interest) with remaining maturities of 60 calendar days or less, securities (including repurchase agreements) that will mature or are subject to a demand feature that is
      exercisable and payable within five business days or amounts receivable and due unconditionally within five business days on pending sales of portfolio securities. For purposes of these two definitions, maturity is determined without &#8220;shortening&#8221;
      maturity to the next interest rate readjustment date, as is permitted under Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act.</div>

      dollar-weighted average life of no greater than 120 calendar days. &#8220;Weighted average life&#8221; is portfolio maturity measured without reference to provisions that otherwise permit the maturity of certain adjustable rate securities to be deemed to be
      &#8220;shortened&#8221; to their interest rate reset dates.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Suspension of redemptions. </font>In the event that (a) the Fund, at the end of a business day, has invested less than 10% of its total assets in weekly liquid assets or (b) the Fund&#8217;s
      price per share as computed for the purpose of distribution, redemption and repurchase, rounded to the nearest 1%, has deviated from the stable price established by the Fund&#8217;s board of trustees or (c) the Trust&#8217;s board of trustees, including a
      majority of trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust as defined in the 1940 Act, determines that such a deviation is likely to occur, and the board of trustees, including a majority of trustees who are not interested persons of the Trust,
      irrevocably has approved the liquidation of the Fund, the Fund&#8217;s board of trustees has the authority to suspend redemptions of Fund shares.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The following is a description of various types of securities, instruments and techniques that may be purchased and/or used by the Fund:</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Borrowing</font>&#160; The 1940 Act and the SEC&#8217;s current rules, exemptions and interpretations thereunder, permit the Fund to borrow up to one-third of the value of its total assets
      (including the amount borrowed, but less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) from banks. The Fund is required to maintain continuous asset coverage of at least 300% with respect to such borrowings and to reduce the
      amount of its borrowings (within three days excluding Sundays and holidays) to restore such coverage if it should decline to less than 300% due to market fluctuations or otherwise. In the event that the Fund is required to reduce its borrowings, it
      may have to sell portfolio holdings, even if such sale of the Fund&#8217;s holdings would be disadvantageous from an investment standpoint.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">If the Fund makes additional investments while borrowings are outstanding, this may be considered a form of leverage. Leveraging by means of borrowing may exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value
      of portfolio securities on the Fund&#8217;s net asset value, and money borrowed will be subject to interest and other costs (which may include commitment fees and/or the cost of maintaining minimum average balances), which may or may not exceed the income
      or gains received from the securities purchased with borrowed funds.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">In addition to borrowings that are subject to 300% asset coverage and are considered by the SEC to be permitted &#8220;senior securities,&#8221; the Fund is also permitted under the 1940 Act to borrow for temporary purposes in an
      amount not exceeding 5% of the value of its total assets at the time when the loan is made. A loan will be presumed to be for temporary purposes if it is repaid within 60 days and is not extended or renewed.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Debt securities - general description</font>&#160; In general, a debt security represents a loan of money to the issuer by the purchaser of the security. A debt security typically has a fixed
      payment schedule that obligates the issuer to pay interest to the lender and to return the lender&#8217;s money over a certain time period. A company typically meets its payment obligations associated with its outstanding debt securities before it declares
      and pays any dividend to holders of its equity securities. Bonds, notes and commercial paper are examples of debt securities and differ in the length of the issuer&#8217;s principal repayment schedule, with bonds carrying the longest repayment schedule and
      commercial paper the shortest:</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Bonds. </font>A bond is a debt security in which investors lend money to an entity that borrows for a defined period of time, usually a period of more than five years, at a specified
      interest rate.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Debentures. </font>A debenture is an unsecured debt security backed only by the creditworthiness of the borrower, not by collateral.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Bills. </font>A bill is a short-term debt instrument, usually with a maturity of two years or less.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Notes. </font>A note is a debt security usually with a maturity of up to ten years.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">For purposes of the discussion in this SAI of the risks of investing in debt securities generally, loans or other short-term instruments, which otherwise may not technically be considered securities, are included.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Debt securities are all generally subject to interest rate, credit, income and prepayment risks and, like all investments, are subject to liquidity and market risks to varying degrees depending upon the specific terms
      and type of security. The Fund&#8217;s investment manager attempts to reduce credit and market risk through diversification of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio and ongoing credit analysis of each issuer, as well as by monitoring economic developments, but there can be
      no assurance that it will be successful at doing so.</div>

        <hr noshade="noshade" style="margin: 4px 0px; width: 100%; border-width: 0; height: 2px; color: #000000; background-color: #000000; clear: both;"></div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 8pt;"><br>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Illiquid securities</font>&#160; Generally, an &#8220;illiquid security&#8221; is any security that cannot be disposed of partially or in full in the ordinary course of business within seven days at
      approximately the amount at which the Fund has valued the instrument. Illiquid securities generally include securities for which no market exists or which are legally restricted as to their transfer (such as those issued pursuant to an exemption from
      the registration requirements of the federal securities laws). Restricted securities are generally sold in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). If
      registration of a security previously acquired in a private transaction is required, the Fund, as the holder of the security, may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expense and a considerable period may elapse between the time it
      decides to seek registration and the time it will be permitted to sell a security under an effective registration statement. If, during such a period, adverse market conditions were to develop, the Fund might obtain a less favorable price than
      prevailed when it decided to seek registration of the security. To the extent the investment manager determines there is a liquid institutional or other market for restricted securities, the Fund considers them to be liquid securities. An example is
      a restricted security that may be freely transferred among qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, and for which a liquid institutional market has developed. Rule 144A securities may be subject, however, to a greater
      possibility of becoming illiquid than securities that have been registered with the SEC.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund&#8217;s board will review on a periodic basis any determination by the investment manager to treat a restricted security as liquid. In determining whether a restricted security is properly considered a liquid
      security, the investment manager takes into account the following factors: (i) the frequency of trades and quotes for the security; (ii) the number of dealers willing to buy or sell the security and the number of other potential buyers; (iii) any
      dealer undertakings to make a market in the security; and (iv) the nature of the security and of the marketplace trades (e.g., any demand, put or tender features, the method of soliciting offers, the mechanics and other requirements for transfer, and
      the ability to assign or offset the rights and obligations of the security). The nature of the security and its trading includes the time needed to sell the security, the method of soliciting offers to purchase or sell the security, and the mechanics
      of transferring the security including the role of parties such as foreign or U.S. custodians, subcustodians, currency exchange brokers, and depositories.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The sale of illiquid securities often requires more time and results in higher brokerage charges or dealer discounts and other selling expenses than the sale of securities eligible for trading on national securities
      exchanges or in the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Illiquid securities often sell at a price lower than similar securities that are not subject to restrictions on resale.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The risk to the Fund in holding illiquid securities is that they may be more difficult to sell if the Fund wants to dispose of the security in response to adverse developments or in order to raise money for redemptions
      or other investment opportunities. Illiquid trading conditions may also make it more difficult for the Fund to realize a security&#8217;s fair value.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund may also be unable to achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain security, issuer, or sector due to overall limitations on its ability to invest in illiquid securities and the difficulty in purchasing
      such securities.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Interfund lending program</font>&#160; Pursuant to an exemptive order granted by the SEC (Lending Order), the Fund has the ability to lend money to, and borrow money from, other XFT
      XFT funds for temporary purposes (Interfund Lending Program) pursuant to a master interfund lending agreement (Interfund Loan). Lending and borrowing through the Interfund Lending Program provides the borrowing fund with a lower interest rate
      than it would have paid if it borrowed money from a bank, and provides the lending fund with an alternative short-term investment with a higher rate of return than other available short-term investments. All Interfund Loans would consist only of
      uninvested cash reserves that the lending fund otherwise would invest in short-term repurchase agreements or other short-term instruments. The Fund may only participate in the Interfund Lending Program to the extent permitted by its investment
      goal(s), policies and restrictions and only subject to meeting the conditions of the Lending Order.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The limitations of the Interfund Lending Program are described below and these and the other conditions of the Lending Order permitting interfund lending are designed to minimize the risks associated with interfund
      lending for both the lending and borrowing fund. However, no borrowing or lending activity is without risk. When a fund borrows money from another fund under the Interfund Lending Program, there is a risk that the Interfund Loan could be called on
      one business day&#8217;s notice, in which case the</div>

    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><br>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">borrowing fund may have to utilize a line of credit, which would likely involve higher rates, seek an Interfund Loan from another fund, or liquidate portfolio securities if no lending sources are available to meet its
      liquidity needs. Interfund Loans are subject to the risk that the borrowing fund could be unable to repay the loan when due, and a delay in repayment could result in a lost opportunity by the lending fund or force the lending fund to borrow or
      liquidate securities to meet its liquidity needs.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Under the Interfund Lending Program, the Fund may borrow on an unsecured basis through the Interfund Lending Program if its outstanding borrowings from all sources immediately after the borrowing total 10% or less of
      its total assets, provided that if the Fund has a secured loan outstanding from any other lender, including but not limited to another fund, the Fund&#8217;s Interfund Loan will be secured on at least an equal priority basis with at least an equivalent
      percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding loan that requires collateral. If the Fund&#8217;s total outstanding borrowings immediately after an Interfund Loan exceed 10% of its total assets, the Fund may borrow through the Interfund Lending
      Program on a secured basis only. The Fund may not borrow under the Interfund Lending Program or from any other source if its total outstanding borrowings immediately after such borrowing would be more than 33 1/3% of its total assets or any lower
      threshold provided for by the Fund&#8217;s investment restrictions.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">If the Fund has outstanding bank borrowings, any Interfund Loans to the Fund would: (a) be at an interest rate equal to or lower than that of any outstanding bank loan, (b) be secured at least on an equal priority basis
      with at least an equivalent percentage of collateral to loan value as any outstanding bank loan that requires collateral, (c) have a maturity no longer than any outstanding bank loan (and in any event not over seven days), and (d) provide that, if an
      event of default by the Fund occurs under any agreement evidencing an outstanding bank loan to the Fund, that event of default will automatically (without need for action or notice by the lending Fund) constitute an immediate event of default under
      the interfund lending agreement, entitling the lending fund to call the Interfund Loan (and exercise all rights with respect to any collateral), and that such call would be made if the lending bank exercises its right to call its loan under its
      agreement with the borrowing fund.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">In addition, no fund may lend to another fund through the Interfund Lending Program if the loan would cause the lending fund&#8217;s aggregate outstanding loans through the Interfund Lending Program to exceed 15% of its
      current net assets at the time of the loan. A fund&#8217;s Interfund Loans to any one fund shall not exceed 5% of the lending fund&#8217;s net assets. The duration of Interfund Loans will be limited to the time required to obtain cash sufficient to repay such
      Interfund Loan, either through the sale of portfolio securities or the net sales of the fund&#8217;s shares, but in no event more than seven days, and for purposes of this condition, loans effected within seven days of each other will be treated as
      separate loan transactions. Each Interfund Loan may be called on one business day&#8217;s notice by a lending fund and may be repaid on any day by a borrowing fund.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Investment grade debt securities</font>&#160; Investment grade debt securities are securities that are rated at the time of purchase in the top four ratings categories by one or more
      independent rating organizations such as S&amp;P (rated BBB- or better) or Moody&#8217;s (rated Baa3 or higher) or, if unrated, are determined to be of comparable quality by the Fund&#8217;s investment manager. Generally, a higher rating indicates the rating
      agency&#8217;s opinion that there is less risk of default of obligations thereunder including timely repayment of principal and payment of interest. Debt securities in the lowest investment grade category may have speculative characteristics and more
      closely resemble high-yield debt securities than investment-grade debt securities. Lower-rated securities may be subject to all the risks applicable to high-yield debt securities and changes in economic conditions or other circumstances are more
      likely to lead to a weakened capacity to make principal and interest payments than is the case with higher grade debt securities.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">A number of risks associated with rating agencies apply to the purchase or sale of investment grade debt securities.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Repurchase agreements</font>&#160; Under a repurchase agreement, the Fund agrees to buy securities guaranteed as to payment of principal and interest by the U.S. government or its agencies or
      instrumentalities from a qualified bank, broker-dealer or other counterparty and then to sell the securities back to such counterparty on an agreed upon date (generally less than seven days) at a higher price, which reflects currently prevailing
      short-term interest rates. Entering into repurchase agreements allows the Fund to earn a return on cash in the Fund&#8217;s portfolio that would otherwise remain un-invested. The counterparty must transfer to the Fund&#8217;s custodian, as collateral, securities
      with an initial market value of at least 102% (in the case of a counterparty that is a bank or broker-dealer) or 100% (if the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) is the</div>

        <hr noshade="noshade" style="margin: 4px 0px; width: 100%; border-width: 0; height: 2px; color: #000000; background-color: #000000; clear: both;"></div>

    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">counterparty) of the dollar amount paid by the Fund to the counterparty. The investment manager will monitor the value of such collateral daily to determine that the value of the collateral equals or exceeds the
      repurchase price. The Fund considers repurchase agreements with the FRBNY to be U.S. Government securities for purposes of the Fund&#8217;s investment policies.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Repurchase agreements may involve risks in the event of default or insolvency of the counterparty, including possible delays or restrictions upon the Fund&#8217;s ability to sell the underlying securities and additional
      expenses in seeking to enforce the Fund&#8217;s rights and recover any losses. The Fund will enter into repurchase agreements only with parties who meet certain creditworthiness standards, i.e., the FRBNY or banks or broker-dealers that the investment
      manager has determined, based on the information available at the time, present no serious risk of becoming involved in bankruptcy proceedings within the time frame contemplated by the repurchase agreement. Although the Fund seeks to limit the credit
      risk under a repurchase agreement by carefully selecting counterparties and accepting only high quality collateral, some credit risk remains. The counterparty could default which may make it necessary for the Fund to incur expenses to liquidate the
      collateral. In addition, the collateral may decline in value before it can be liquidated by the Fund.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">A repurchase agreement with more than seven days to maturity is considered an illiquid security and is subject to the Fund&#8217;s investment restriction on illiquid securities.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Stripped securities</font>&#160; Stripped securities are debt securities that have been transformed from a principal amount with periodic interest coupons into a series of zero coupon bonds,
      each with a different maturity date corresponding to one of the payment dates for interest coupon payments or the redemption date for the principal amount. Stripped securities are subject to all the risks applicable to zero coupon bonds as well as
      certain additional risks.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Like zero coupon bonds, stripped securities do not provide for periodic payments of interest prior to maturity. Rather they are offered at a discount from their face amount that will be paid at maturity. This results in
      the security being subject to greater fluctuations in response to changing interest rates than interest-paying securities of similar maturities. Federal income taxes generally accrue on stripped securities each year although no cash income is
      received until maturity, and the Fund may be required to sell portfolio securities that it would otherwise continue to hold in order to obtain sufficient cash to make distributions to shareholders required for U.S. tax purposes.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The riskiness of an investment in stripped securities depends on the type involved. Some stripped securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Others receive an implied backing by the U.S.
      government as a sponsor or partner in the agency or entity issuing the stripped security. A few are secured with a guarantee from the financial institution or broker or dealer through which the stripped security is held. Others are supported only by
      the collateral, revenue stream or third party guarantee securing the underlying debt obligation from which zero coupon bonds were stripped. Stripped securities include: U.S. Treasury STRIPS, Stripped Government Securities, Stripped Corporate
      Securities, and Stripped Eurodollar Obligations.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Stripped government securities </font>are issued by the U.S. federal, state and local governments and their agencies and instrumentalities, and by &#8220;mixed-ownership government
      corporations.&#8221; Stripped government securities vary widely in the terms, conditions and relative assurances of payment. The type of debt obligation from which the stripped government security was taken will indicate many of the risks associated with
      that investment. U.S. Treasury STRIPS is a type of stripped government securities.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">U.S. Treasury STRIPS (Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities) </font>are considered U.S. Treasury securities for purposes of the Fund&#8217;s investment policies
      and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Their risks are similar to those of other U.S. government securities, although their price may be more volatile. The U.S. Treasury has facilitated transfers of ownership of zero
      coupon securities by accounting separately for the beneficial ownership of particular interest coupon and principal payments on Treasury securities through the Federal Reserve book-entry record-keeping system.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">U.S. government securities</font>&#160; U.S. government securities include obligations of, or securities guaranteed by, the U.S. federal government, its agencies, instrumentalities or
      sponsored enterprises. Some U.S. government securities are supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. These include U.S. Treasury obligations and securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). A second
      category of U.S. government securities are those supported by the right of the agency, instrumentality or sponsored enterprise to borrow from the U.S. government to</div>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">meet its obligations. These include securities issued by Federal Home Loan Banks.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">A third category of U.S. government securities are those supported by only the credit of the issuing agency, instrumentality or sponsored enterprise. These include securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage
      Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). In the event of a default, an investor like the Fund would only have legal recourse to the issuer, not the U.S. government. Although the U.S. government has provided support for
      these securities in the past, there can be no assurance that it will do so in the future. The U.S. government has also made available additional guarantees for limited periods to stabilize or restore a market in the wake of an economic, political or
      natural crisis. Such guarantees, and the economic opportunities they present, are likely to be temporary and cannot be relied upon by the Fund. Any downgrade of the credit rating of the securities issued by the U.S. government may result in a
      downgrade of securities issued by its agencies or instrumentalities, including government-sponsored entities.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Variable rate securities</font>&#160; Variable rate securities are debt securities that provide for periodic adjustments in the interest rate paid on the debt security. Floating rate
      securities, adjustable rate securities and inverse floating rate securities (referred to as &#8220;inverse floaters&#8221;) are types of variable rate securities. An adjustable rate security is a debt security with an interest rate which is adjusted according to
      a formula that specifies the interval at which the rate will be reset and the interest rate index, benchmark or other mechanism upon which the reset rate is based. A floating rate debt security has a rate of interest which is usually established as
      the sum of a base lending rate (e.g., the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the U.S. Prime Rate, the Prime Rate of a designated U.S. bank or the certificate of deposit rate) plus a specified margin. The interest rate on prime rate-based loans
      and securities floats periodically as the prime rate changes. The interest rate on LIBOR-based and CD-based loans and securities is reset periodically, typically at regular intervals ranging between 30 days and one year. Certain floating rate
      securities will permit the borrower to select an interest rate reset period of up to one year.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Some variable rate securities are structured with put features that permit holders to demand payment of the unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest from the issuers or certain financial intermediaries at or about
      the time the interest rate is reset. If the Fund purchases a variable rate security with a put feature and market movements make exercise of the put unattractive, the Fund will forfeit the entire amount of any premium paid plus related transaction
      costs.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Movements in the relevant index or benchmark on which adjustments are based will affect the interest paid on these securities and, therefore, the current income earned by the Fund and the securities&#8217; market value. The
      degree of volatility in the market value of the variable rate securities held by the Fund will generally increase along with the length of time between adjustments, the degree of volatility in the applicable index, benchmark or base lending rate and
      whether the index, benchmark or base lending rate to which it resets or floats approximates short-term or other prevailing interest rates. It will also be a function of the maximum increase or decrease of the interest rate adjustment on any one
      adjustment date, in any one year, and over the life of the security. These maximum increases and decreases are typically referred to as &#8220;caps&#8221; and &#8220;floors,&#8221; respectively.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">During periods when short-term interest rates move within the caps and floors of the security held by the Fund, the interest rate of such security will reset to prevailing rates within a short period. As a result, the
      fluctuation in market value of the variable rate security held by the Fund is generally expected to be limited.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">In periods of substantial short-term volatility in interest rates, the market value of such debt securities may fluctuate more substantially if the caps and/or floors prevent the interest rates from adjusting to the
      full extent of the movements in the market rates during any one adjustment period or over the term of the security. In the event of dramatic increases in interest rates, any lifetime caps on these securities may prevent the securities from adjusting
      to prevailing rates over the term of the security. In either the case of caps or floors, the market value of the securities may be reduced.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The income earned by the Fund and distributed to shareholders will generally increase or decrease along with movements in the relevant index, benchmark or base lending rate. Thus the Fund&#8217;s income will be more
      unpredictable than the income earned on similar investments with a fixed rate of interest.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">When-issued and delayed delivery transactions</font>&#160; When-issued and delayed delivery transactions are arrangements under which the Fund buys securities that have been authorized but
      not yet issued, with payment for and delivery of the security scheduled</div>

    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><br>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">for a future time. To the extent the Fund engages in these transactions, it will do so only for the purpose of acquiring portfolio securities consistent with its investment goals and policies. Although the Fund will
      generally buy securities on a when-issued basis with the intention of holding the securities, the Fund may sell the securities before the settlement date if the investment manager believes it is advisable to do so.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Entering into a when-issued or delayed delivery transaction may be viewed as a form of leverage and will result in associated risks for the Fund. To mitigate these risks, when the Fund enters into this type of
      transaction, it will segregate liquid assets (consisting of cash, cash equivalents or other liquid portfolio securities) equal to the Fund&#8217;s obligations under the transaction, as determined on a daily basis. However, the Fund does not consider the
      purchase and/or sale of securities on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis to be a borrowing for purposes of the Fund&#8217;s fundamental investment restrictions or other limitations on borrowing.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund also relies on the counterparty to complete the transaction. The counterparty&#8217;s failure to do so may cause the Fund to miss a price or yield considered advantageous to the Fund. Although their price typically
      reflects accrued interest, securities purchased on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis do not generally earn interest until their scheduled delivery date. Purchases of securities on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis are also subject to the
      risk that the market value or the yield at delivery may be more or less than the market price or yield available when the transaction was entered into.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Many when-issued or delayed-delivery transactions also are subject to the risk that a counterparty may become bankrupt or otherwise fail to perform its obligations due to financial difficulties, including making
      payments or fulfilling other obligations to the Fund. The Fund may obtain no or only limited recovery in a bankruptcy or other organizational proceedings, and any recovery may be significantly delayed.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The following is a description of the general <font style="font-weight: bold;">risks </font>associated with the Fund&#8217;s investing in debt securities:</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Credit</font>&#160; Debt securities are subject to the risk of an issuer&#8217;s (or other party&#8217;s) failure or inability to meet its obligations under the security. Multiple parties may have
      obligations under a debt security. An issuer or borrower may fail to pay principal and interest when due. A guarantor, insurer or credit support provider may fail to provide the agreed upon protection. A counterparty to a transaction may fail to
      perform its side of the bargain. An intermediary or agent interposed between the investor and other parties may fail to perform the terms of its service. Also, performance under a debt security may be linked to the obligations of other persons who
      may fail to meet their obligations. The credit risk associated with a debt security could increase to the extent that the Fund&#8217;s ability to benefit fully from its investment in the security depends on the performance by multiple parties of their
      respective contractual or other obligations. The market value of a debt security is also affected by the market&#8217;s perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund may incur substantial losses on debt securities that are inaccurately perceived to present a different amount of credit risk than they actually do by the market, the investment manager or the rating agencies.
      Credit risk is generally greater where less information is publicly available, where fewer covenants safeguard the investors&#8217; interests, where collateral may be impaired or inadequate, where little legal redress or regulatory protection is available,
      or where a party&#8217;s ability to meet obligations is speculative. Additionally, any inaccuracy in the information used by the Fund to evaluate credit risk may affect the value of securities held by the Fund.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Obligations under debt securities held by the Fund may never be satisfied or, if satisfied, only satisfied in part.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Some securities are subject to risks as a result of a credit downgrade or default by a government, or its agencies or, instrumentalities. Credit risk is a greater concern for high-yield debt securities and debt
      securities of issuers whose ability to pay interest and principal may be considered speculative. Debt securities are typically classified as investment grade-quality (medium to highest credit quality) or below investment grade-quality (commonly
      referred to as high-yield or junk bonds). Many individual debt securities are rated by a third party source, such as Moody&#8217;s or S&amp;P to help describe the creditworthiness of the issuer.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Debt securities ratings</font>&#160; The investment manager performs its own independent investment analysis of securities being considered for the Fund&#8217;s portfolio, which includes
      consideration of, among other things, the issuer&#8217;s financial resources, its sensitivity to economic conditions and trends, its operating history, the quality of the issuer&#8217;s management and regulatory matters. The investment manager also considers the
      ratings assigned by various investment services and independent rating agencies, such as Moody&#8217;s and</div>

        <hr noshade="noshade" style="margin: 4px 0px; width: 100%; border-width: 0; height: 2px; color: #000000; background-color: #000000; clear: both;"></div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><br>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">S&amp;P, that publish ratings based upon their assessment of the relative creditworthiness of the rated debt securities. Generally, a lower rating indicates higher credit risk. Higher yields are ordinarily available
      from debt securities in the lower rating categories. These ratings are described at the end of this SAI under &#8220;Description of Ratings.&#8221;</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Using credit ratings to evaluate debt securities can involve certain risks. For example, ratings assigned by the rating agencies are based upon an analysis completed at the time of the rating of the obligor&#8217;s ability to
      pay interest and repay principal. Rating agencies typically rely to a large extent on historical data which may not accurately represent present or future circumstances. Ratings do not purport to reflect the risk of fluctuations in market value of
      the debt security and are not absolute standards of quality and only express the rating agency&#8217;s current opinion of an obligor&#8217;s overall financial capacity to pay its financial obligations. A credit rating is not a statement of fact or a
      recommendation to purchase, sell or hold a debt obligation. Also, credit quality can change suddenly and unexpectedly, and credit ratings may not reflect the issuer&#8217;s current financial condition or events since the security was last rated. Rating
      agencies may have a financial interest in generating business, including from the arranger or issuer of the security that normally pays for that rating, and providing a low rating might affect the rating agency&#8217;s prospects for future business. While
      rating agencies have policies and procedures to address this potential conflict of interest, there is a risk that these policies will fail to prevent a conflict of interest from impacting the rating.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Income</font>&#160; Income risk is the risk that the Fund&#8217;s income will decline during periods of falling interest rates, when the Fund experiences defaults on debt securities it holds or
      when the Fund realizes a loss upon a sale of a debt security. The Fund&#8217;s income declines when interest rates fall because, as the Fund&#8217;s higher-yielding debt securities mature, are prepaid or are sold, the Fund may have to re-invest the proceeds in
      debt securities that have lower interest rates. The amount and rate of distributions that the Fund&#8217;s shareholders receive are affected by the income that the Fund receives from its portfolio holdings. If the income is reduced, distributions by the
      Fund to shareholders may be less.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Fluctuations in income paid to the Fund are generally greater for variable rate debt securities. The Fund will be deemed to receive taxable income on certain securities which pay no cash payments until maturity, such as
      zero-coupon securities. The Fund may be required to sell portfolio securities that it would otherwise continue to hold in order to obtain sufficient cash to make the distribution to shareholders required for U.S. tax purposes.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Inflation</font>&#160; The market price of debt securities generally falls as inflation increases because the purchasing power of the future income and repaid principal is expected to be
      worth less when received by the Fund. Debt securities that pay a fixed rather than variable interest rate are especially vulnerable to inflation risk because variable-rate debt securities may be able to participate, over the long term, in rising
      interest rates which have historically corresponded with long-term inflationary trends.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Interest rate</font>&#160; The market value of debt securities generally varies in response to changes in prevailing interest rates. Interest rate changes can be sudden and unpredictable. In
      addition, short-term and long-term rates are not necessarily correlated to each other as short-term rates tend to be influenced by government monetary policy while long-term rates are market driven and may be influenced by macroeconomic events (such
      as economic expansion or contraction), inflation expectations, as well as supply and demand. During periods of declining interest rates, the market value of debt securities generally increases. Conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the
      market value of debt securities generally declines. This occurs because new debt securities are likely to be issued with higher interest rates as interest rates increase, making the old or outstanding debt securities less attractive. In general, the
      market prices of long-term debt securities or securities that make little (or no) interest payments are more sensitive to interest rate fluctuations than shorter-term debt securities. The longer the Fund&#8217;s average weighted portfolio duration, the
      greater the potential impact a change in interest rates will have on its share price. Also, certain segments of the fixed income markets, such as high quality bonds, tend to be more sensitive to interest rate changes than other segments, such as
      lower-quality bonds.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Prepayment</font>&#160; Debt securities, especially bonds that are subject to &#8220;calls,&#8221; such as asset-backed or mortgage-backed securities, are subject to prepayment risk if their terms allow
      the payment of principal and other amounts due before their stated maturity. Amounts invested in a debt security that has been &#8220;called&#8221; or &#8220;prepaid&#8221; will be returned to an investor holding that security before expected by the investor. In such
      circumstances, the investor, such as a fund, may be required to re-invest the proceeds it receives from the called or prepaid security in a new security which, in periods of declining interest rates, will typically have a lower interest rate.
      Prepayment</div>
    <div id="DSPFPageBreakArea" style="clear: both; margin-top: 10pt; margin-bottom: 10pt;">
      <div style="text-align: center;" id="DSPFPageNumberArea"><font style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif; font-size: 8pt; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;" id="DSPFPageNumber">10</font></div>

        <hr noshade="noshade" style="margin: 4px 0px; width: 100%; border-width: 0; height: 2px; color: #000000; background-color: #000000; clear: both;"></div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><br>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">risk is especially prevalent in periods of declining interest rates and will result for other reasons, including unexpected developments in the markets for the underlying assets or mortgages. For example, a decline in
      mortgage interest rates typically initiates a period of mortgage refinancings. When homeowners refinance their mortgages, the investor in the underlying pool of mortgage-backed securities (such as a fund) receives its principal back sooner than
      expected, and must reinvest at lower, prevailing rates.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Securities subject to prepayment risk are often called during a declining interest rate environment and generally offer less potential for gains and greater price volatility than other income-bearing securities of
      comparable maturity.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Call risk is similar to prepayment risk and results from the ability of an issuer to call, or prepay, a debt security early. If interest rates decline enough, the debt security&#8217;s issuer can save money by repaying its
      callable debt securities and issuing new debt securities at lower interest rates.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The following is a description of other <font style="font-weight: bold;">risks </font>associated with the Fund&#8217;s investments:</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Liquidity</font>&#160; Liquidity risk exists when particular investments are or become difficult to purchase or sell at the price at which the Fund has valued the security, whether because of
      current market conditions, the financial condition of the issuer, or the specific type of investment. If the market for a particular security becomes illiquid (for example, due to changes in the issuer&#8217;s financial condition), the Fund may be unable
      to sell such security at an advantageous time or price due to the difficulty in selling such securities. To the extent that the Fund and its affiliates hold a significant portion of an issuer&#8217;s outstanding securities, the Fund may also be subject to
      greater liquidity risk than if the issuer&#8217;s securities were more widely held. The Fund may also need to sell some of the Fund&#8217;s more liquid securities when it otherwise would not do so in order to meet redemption requests, even if such sale of the
      liquid holdings would be disadvantageous from an investment standpoint. Reduced liquidity may also have an adverse impact on a security&#8217;s market value and the sale of such securities often results in higher brokerage charges or dealer discounts and
      other selling expenses. Reduced liquidity in the secondary market for certain securities will also make it more difficult for the Fund to obtain market quotations based on actual trades for purposes of valuing the Fund&#8217;s portfolio and thus pricing
      may be prone to error when market quotations are volatile, infrequent and/or subject to large spreads between bid and ask prices. In addition, prices received by the Fund for securities may be based on institutional &#8220;round lot&#8221; sizes, but the Fund
      may purchase, hold or sell smaller, &#8220;odd lot&#8221; sizes, which may be harder to sell. Odd lots may trade at lower prices than round lots, which may affect the Fund&#8217;s ability to accurately value its investments.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The market for certain equity or debt securities may become illiquid under adverse market or economic conditions independent of any specific adverse changes in the conditions of a particular issuer. For example, dealer
      capacity in certain fixed income markets appears to have undergone fundamental changes since the financial crisis of 2008, which may result in low dealer inventories and a reduction in dealer market-making capacity. An increase in interest rates due
      to the tapering of the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s quantitative easing program and other similar central bank actions, coupled with a reduction in dealer market-making capacity, may decrease liquidity and increase volatility in the fixed income markets.
      Liquidity risk generally increases (meaning that securities become more illiquid) as the number, or relative need, of investors seeking to liquidate in a given market increases; for example, when an asset class or classes fall out of favor and
      investors sell their holdings in such classes, either directly or indirectly through investment funds, such as mutual funds.</div>
    <div style="margin-right: 3.6pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Management</font>&#160; The investment manager&#8217;s judgments about markets, interest rates or the attractiveness, relative values or potential appreciation of particular
      investment strategies or sectors or securities purchased for the Fund&#8217;s portfolio may prove to be incorrect, all of which could cause the Fund to perform less favorably and may result in a decline in the Fund&#8217;s share price.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The investment manager selects investments for the Fund based on its own analysis and information as well as on external sources of information, such as information that the investment manager obtains from other sources
      including through conferences and discussions with third parties, and data that issuers of securities provide to the investment manager or file with government agencies. The investment manager may also use information concerning institutional
      positions and buying activity in a security. The investment manager is not in a position to confirm the completeness, genuineness or accuracy of any of such information that is provided or filed by an issuer, and in some cases, complete and accurate
      information is not readily available. It is also possible that information on which the investment manager relies could be wrong or misleading.</div>

    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><br>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may affect the investment techniques available to the investment manager in connection with managing the Fund and may also adversely affect the ability of the
      Fund to achieve its investment goal. Management risk is greater when less qualitative information is available to the investment manager about an investment.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Although the investment manager has experience managing mutual funds and risk oversight, it has limited experience in the blockchain technology industry. More detailed information about distributed ledger technology and
      the Stellar network, including the regulatory, operational and technological risks associated with distributed ledger technology and the Stellar network, is included in the sections below entitled <font style="font-style: italic;">&#8220;Blockchain-Based
        Shares,&#8221; &#8220;The Stellar Network,&#8221; &#8220;Blockchain Regulation,&#8221; and &#8220;Operations and Technology.&#8221; </font>On account of these risks, the Fund may never achieve market acceptance and may not be able to attract sizable assets or achieve scale. Under these
      circumstances, the investment manager and the Fund&#8217;s board of trustees may take actions including, potentially, restructuring or liquidating the Fund.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Market</font>&#160; The market value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably due to general market conditions which are not specifically related
      to a single corporate borrower or security issuer. These general market conditions include real or perceived adverse economic or regulatory conditions, changes in the general outlook for corporate earnings, changes in interest or currency exchange
      rates or adverse investor sentiment generally. Market values may also decline due to factors which affect a particular industry or sector, such as labor shortages or increased production costs and competitive conditions within an industry, or a
      particular segment, such as mortgage or government securities. During a general downturn in the securities markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value simultaneously. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that the Fund&#8217;s
      securities will participate in or otherwise benefit from the advance.</div>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Blockchain-Based Shares</font>&#160; Although the Fund&#8217;s transfer agent will maintain the official record of share ownership in book-entry form, the ownership of the Fund&#8217;s shares will also
      be recorded on the Stellar network, an electronic distributed ledger that is secured using cryptography (referred to as the &#8220;blockchain&#8221;). Transactions on the blockchain are verified and authenticated by computers on the network (referred to as
      &#8220;nodes&#8221; or &#8220;network validators&#8221;) that receive, propagate, verify, and execute transactions. Users of the Stellar network must pay transaction fees (in the form of &#8220;Stellar Lumens,&#8221; the native digital asset for the operation of Stellar) to the Stellar
      network in order to validate a transaction. Such transaction fees are intended to protect the Stellar ledger from frivolous or malicious computational tasks. These transaction fees will be the responsibility of the investment manager or its
      affiliates or a third party.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The process of authenticating a transaction before it is recorded ensures that only valid and authorized transactions are permanently recorded on the blockchain. However, in the event of a conflict between the
      blockchain record and the record held by the transfer agent, the transfer agent&#8217;s record will be determinative. A discrepancy between the blockchain record and the official record of share ownership could result in a delay of the processing of
      purchase and redemption orders. The use of distributed ledger technology is untested for mutual funds.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Upon the creation of an account through the App, a blockchain wallet and a corresponding public and private key pair will be created for each investor. A key pair consists of a public key and its corresponding private
      key, both of which are lengthy numerical codes, derived together and possessing a unique relationship. Public keys are used to create wallet addresses. Private keys are used to sign transactions that initiate the transfer of a digital asset from a
      sender&#8217;s wallet address to a recipient&#8217;s wallet address. Only the holder of the private key associated with a particular wallet address can digitally sign a transaction proposing a transfer of the digital asset from that particular wallet address.
      Investors will be provided with the public key for their wallets, and they will be able to track the balance of any Fund shares in their wallets through the App as well as on a public &#8220;block explorer&#8221; tool capable of displaying activity on the
      Stellar network. A third party digital asset custodian will be responsible for custody of the private keys associated with each shareholder&#8217;s shares.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">In the future, the ownership of the Fund&#8217;s shares may be maintained and recorded solely on the Stellar network, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. There are risks associated with the issuance,
      redemption, transfer, custody and record keeping of shares maintained and recorded on an electronic distributed ledger. For example, shares that are issued using distributed ledger technology would be subject to the following risks (among others):</div>

    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 8pt;"><br>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">1.&#160; a rapidly-evolving regulatory landscape in the United States and in other countries, which might result in security, privacy or other regulatory concerns that could require changes to the way transactions in the
      shares are recorded and/or, if permitted in the future, traded;</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">2.&#160; the possibility of undiscovered technical flaws in an underlying technology, including in the process by which transactions are recorded to a distributed ledger (particularly, the Stellar network ledger), or by
      which the validity of a copy of such ledger can be mathematically proven utilizing cryptographically-secured distributed ledger technology;</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">3.&#160; the possibility that cryptographic or other security measures that authenticate prior transactions for a distributed ledger could be compromised, or &#8220;hacked,&#8221; which could allow an attacker to alter the distributed
      ledger and thereby disrupt the ability to corroborate definitive transactions recorded on the distributed ledger;</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">4.&#160; the possibility that new technologies or services inhibit access to a distributed ledger; and</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">5.&#160; the possibility that a breach to one distributed ledger could cause investors, and the public generally, to lose trust in distributed ledger technology and increase reluctance to issue and invest in assets recorded
      on distributed ledgers.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Delays in transaction processing have occurred on the Stellar network.&#160; Such a delay may occur on account of, among other things, the inability of nodes to reach consensus on transactions.&#160; During a network delay, it
      will not be possible to record transactions in the shares on the blockchain. Should such a delay occur for an extended period of time, the Fund could choose to effect transactions with shareholders manually (i.e., in book-entry form) until such time
      as the network has resumed normal operation. The Fund may choose to reevaluate the suitability of the Stellar network for the Fund&#8217;s shares in the event of future or recurring delays.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">The Stellar Network</font>&#160; The suitability of the Stellar network (and its underlying blockchain ledger) on which the shares will rely could decline due to a variety of causes,
      adversely affecting the functionality of the shares and an investment in the Fund. Blockchain networks are based on software protocols that govern the peer-to-peer interactions between computers connected to these networks. The suitability of the
      Stellar network for the functionality of the shares depends upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">1.&#160; The effectiveness of the informal groups of (often uncompensated) developers contributing to the protocols that underlie the network;</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">2.&#160; Effectiveness of the network validators and the network&#8217;s consensus mechanisms to effectively secure the network against confirmation of invalid transactions;</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">3.&#160; The continued participation of a number of trusted network validators;</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">4.&#160; The lack of collusion between trusted network validators;</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">5.&#160; Disputes among the developers or validators of the network;</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">6.&#160; Changes in the consensus or validation scheme that underlies the network;</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">7.&#160; The failure of cybersecurity controls or security breaches of the network;</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">8.&#160; The inability of validators to reach consensus and the consequential halting of transaction verification on the network;</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">9.&#160; The existence of undiscovered technical flaws in the network;</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">10.&#160; The development of new or existing hardware or software tools or mechanisms that could negatively impact the functionality of the systems;</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">11.&#160; The price of Lumens, the blockchain asset associated with the network;</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">12.&#160; The cost of transaction fees to use the Stellar network;</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">13.&#160; Intellectual property rights-based or other claims against the network&#8217;s participants;</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">14.&#160; The continued adoption of the Stellar network; and</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">15.&#160; The maturity of the computer software programming software development kit (&#8220;SDK&#8221;) used in connection with the network.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Unfavorable developments or characteristics of any of the above or other circumstances could adversely affect the Fund&#8217;s operations or the functionality of the shares.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Furthermore, copies of the Stellar ledger will be available to the public and will store the complete transaction history from issuance of the shares. As a result, robust and transparent data, other than a shareholder&#8217;s
      personal identifying information, will be publicly available via block explorers. The shares&#8217; issuance and redemption data will be secured by cryptography and only a public-key-derived wallet</div>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">address (and not a shareholder&#8217;s personal identifying information) will be exposed to the public. The personal identifying information necessary to associate a public key representing a given share with the record owner
      of that share will be maintained by [&#160;] and the Fund&#8217;s transfer agent in a separate database that is not available to the public. If there are data security breaches with respect to [&#160;]&#8217;s or the transfer agent&#8217;s database resulting in theft of the
      information necessary to link personal identity with public keys, the stolen information could be used to determine a shareholder&#8217;s identity and complete investing history in the Fund. Moreover, concerns over these privacy issues may limit adoption
      of public-ledger blockchain technology, reducing the potential market acceptance for the shares and the size of the Fund.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Blockchain Regulation</font>&#160; Regulation of digital assets, blockchain technologies and digital asset platforms is currently developing and likely to rapidly evolve, varies significantly
      among international, federal, state and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Various legislative and executive bodies in the United States and in other countries are currently considering, or may in the future consider, laws, regulations, guidance, or other actions, which may severely impact the
      Fund, and thus the Fund&#8217;s shareholders. Failure by the Fund or any Fund service provider to comply with any laws, rules or regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a
      variety of adverse consequences to the Fund (and thus to the Fund&#8217;s shareholders), including civil penalties and fines.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">New or changing laws and regulations or interpretations of existing laws and regulations may adversely impact the Fund&#8217;s ability to issue and redeem shares or otherwise make distributions on shares, the secondary market
      liquidity and market price of shares (should such secondary market liquidity be available in the future), shareholders&#8217; ability to access or otherwise utilize an exchange or platform for trading of the shares (should such a platform or exchange exist
      in the future and such activity be permitted by the Fund) and the structure, rights and transferability of the shares (should shareholders be permitted to transfer or exchange shares in the future). Therefore, there can be no assurance that any new
      or continuing regulatory scrutiny or initiatives will not have an adverse impact on the shares or impede the Fund&#8217;s current or future activities.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">In addition, because of the differences between the way the shares are issued and recorded as compared to shares in a traditional mutual fund, there is a risk that issues that might easily be resolved by existing law if
      traditional methods were involved may not be easily resolved for the shares. The occurrence of any related issue or dispute could have a material adverse effect on the Fund&#8217;s current or future business or the shares.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Blockchain networks currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape in not only the United States but also in many foreign jurisdictions such as the European Union and China. Various foreign jurisdictions may, in the
      near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the Stellar network and its users, developers and service providers that fall within such jurisdictions&#8217; regulatory scope. Such laws, regulations or directives may conflict with those of
      the United States or may directly and negatively impact the Fund and its service providers. The effect of any future regulatory change is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and adverse to the shareholders, the Fund and the
      Fund&#8217;s service providers.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Operations and Technology</font>&#160; The Fund, its service providers and other market participants increasingly depend on complex information technology and communications systems to
      conduct business functions. These systems are subject to a number of different threats or risks that could adversely affect the Fund, despite the efforts of the Fund and its service providers to adopt technologies, processes, and practices intended
      to mitigate these risks. For example, unauthorized third parties may attempt to improperly access, modify, disrupt the operations of, or prevent access to these systems of the Fund, the Fund&#8217;s service providers, counterparties, or other market
      participants or data within them (a &#8220;cyber-attack&#8221;). In addition, power or communications outages, acts of god, information technology equipment malfunctions, operational errors, and inaccuracies within software or data processing systems may also
      disrupt business operations or impact critical data. If such an event occurs, the Fund may incur substantial costs, including those associated with forensic analysis of the origin and scope of the event; increased and upgraded cybersecurity;
      investment losses from sabotaged trading systems; identity theft; unauthorized use of proprietary information; litigation; adverse investor reaction; the dissemination of confidential and proprietary information; and reputational damage. Any such
      event could expose the Fund to civil liability as well as regulatory inquiry and/or action. In addition, market events also may trigger a volume of</div>

    <div style="margin-right: 50.4pt; margin-bottom: 12pt; font-style: italic;">Policies and Procedures Regarding the Release of Portfolio Holdings</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund&#8217;s overall policy with respect to the release of portfolio holdings is to release such information consistent with applicable legal requirements and the fiduciary duties owed to shareholders. Subject to the
      limited exceptions described below, the Fund will not make available to anyone non-public information with respect to its portfolio holdings, until such time as the information is made available to all shareholders or the general public.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">For purposes of this policy, portfolio holdings information does not include aggregate, composite or descriptive information that does not present risks of dilution, arbitrage, market timing, insider trading or other
      inappropriate trading for the Fund. Information excluded from the definition of portfolio holdings information generally includes, without limitation: (1) descriptions of allocations among asset classes, regions, countries or industries/sectors; (2)
      aggregated data such as average or median ratios, market capitalization, credit quality or duration; (3) performance attributions by industry, sector or country; or (4) aggregated risk statistics. Such information, if made available to anyone, will
      be made available to any person upon request, but, because such information is generally not material to investors, it may or may not be posted on the Fund&#8217;s website. In addition, other information may also be deemed to not be portfolio holdings
      information if, in the reasonable belief of the Fund&#8217;s Chief Compliance Officer (or his/her designee), the release of such information would not present risks of dilution, arbitrage, market timing, insider trading or other inappropriate trading for
      the Fund.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Information concerning the Fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings as well as its dollar-weighted average portfolio maturity as of the last business day or any subsequent calendar day of the preceding month will be posted on its
      website no later than five business days after the end of the month and remain posted on the website for six months thereafter. In addition, the Fund files monthly with the SEC portfolio holdings and other information about the Fund and its portfolio
      as of the last business day of the preceding month (or any subsequent calendar day of such month) within five business days of the end of each month. This information is made public upon filing.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">In addition, a complete list of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings is generally released no sooner than 20 calendar days after the end of each calendar month. Commentaries and other materials that may reference specific
      holdings information of the Fund as of the most recent calendar quarter end are also subject to the same 20-day lag requirement. Other descriptive information, such as the Fund&#8217;s top 10 holdings, may be released monthly, no sooner than five days
      after the end of each month. Released portfolio holdings information can be viewed through the App or online at XFTXFT.com.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">To the extent that this policy would permit the release of portfolio holdings information regarding a particular portfolio holding for the Fund that is the subject of ongoing purchase or sale orders/ programs, or if the
      release of such portfolio holdings information would otherwise be sensitive or inappropriate, the portfolio manager for the Fund may request that the release of such information be withheld.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Exceptions to the portfolio holdings release policy will be made only when: (1) the Fund has a legitimate business purpose for releasing portfolio holdings information in advance of release to all shareholders or the
      general public; (2) the recipient is subject to a duty of confidentiality pursuant to a signed non-disclosure agreement; and (3) the release of such information would not otherwise violate the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws or
      fiduciary duties owed to Fund shareholders. The determination of whether to grant an exception, which includes the determination of whether the Fund has a legitimate business purpose for releasing portfolio holdings information in advance of release
      to all shareholders or the general public shall be made by the Fund&#8217;s Chief Compliance Officer or his/her designee, following a request submitted in writing.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The eligible third parties to whom portfolio holdings information may be released in advance of general release fall into the following categories: data consolidators (including rating agencies), fund rating/ranking
      services and other data providers, service providers to the Fund, and municipal securities brokers using the Investor Tools product which brings together buyers and sellers of municipal securities in the normal operation of the municipal securities
      markets. In addition, should the Fund process a shareholder&#8217;s redemption request in-kind, the Fund may, under certain circumstances, provide portfolio holdings information to such shareholder to the extent necessary to allow the shareholder to
      prepare for receipt of such portfolio securities.</div>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Several investment managers within X Financial Technologies Investments (F-T Managers) serve as investment managers to offshore funds that are registered or otherwise authorized for sale with foreign regulatory authorities.
      The release of portfolio holdings information for such offshore funds is excluded from the Fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings release policy if such information is given to offshore banks, broker-dealers, insurance companies, registered investment managers
      and other financial institutions (offshore investment managers) with discretionary authority to select offshore funds on behalf of their clients. Because such offshore funds may from time to time invest in securities substantially similar to those of
      the Fund, there is the risk that such portfolio holdings information may be used to trade inappropriately against the Fund. To mitigate such risks, such information may only be disclosed for portfolio analytics, such as risk analysis/asset
      allocation, and the offshore investment manager will be required to execute a non-disclosure agreement, whereby such offshore investment manager: (1) agrees to maintain such information as confidential, including limiting the dissemination of such
      information, (2) is prohibited from trading on the information received, including (a) purchasing or selling any portfolio securities based on any information received; (b) trading against any U.S. registered XFT or XFT fund, including the
      Fund; (c) knowingly engaging in any trading practices that are adverse to any such fund; and (d) trading in shares of any such fund that is substantially similar to the offshore fund, and (3) agrees to refresh its representation as to confidentiality
      and abstention from trading upon request from X Financial Technologies. In addition, an offshore fund may release information regarding the top contributors and detractors to such fund&#8217;s portfolio performance monthly to those recipients who have executed a
      non-disclosure agreement containing the provisions described above, or who have confirmed electronically its agreement to such provisions. Country-specific offshore funds that are not, in the aggregate, substantially similar to the holdings of a U.S.
      registered XFT or XFT fund, are not subject to the restrictions imposed by the policy.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Certain F-T Managers serve as investment advisers to privately placed funds that are exempt from registration, including Canadian institutional pooled funds and commingled trusts maintained by a X Financial Technologies trust
      company. In certain circumstances, such unregistered private funds may have portfolio holdings that are not, in the aggregate, substantially similar to the holdings of a U.S. registered fund, as determined by the Chief Compliance Officer or his/her
      designee. Under such circumstances the release of portfolio holdings</div>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><br>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">information to a client or potential client of the unregistered private fund may be permissible. In circumstances where an unregistered private fund invests in portfolio securities that, in the aggregate, are
      substantially similar to the holdings of a U.S. registered fund, such private funds are subject to the restrictions imposed by the policy, except that the release of holdings information to a current investor in the private fund is permissible
      conditioned upon such investor&#8217;s execution of a non-disclosure agreement to mitigate the risk that portfolio holdings information may be used to trade inappropriately against a fund. Such non-disclosure agreement must provide that the investor: (1)
      agrees to maintain such information as confidential, including limiting the dissemination of such information (except that the investor may be permitted to disseminate such information to an agent as necessary to allow the performance of portfolio
      analytics with respect to the investor&#8217;s investment in the private fund), and (2) is prohibited from trading on the information received, including (a) trading against any U.S. registered XFT or XFT fund, including the Fund; (b) knowingly
      engaging in any trading practices that are adverse to any such fund; and (c) trading in shares of any U.S. registered XFT or XFT fund that is managed in a style substantially similar to that of the private fund.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Some F-T Managers serve as sub-advisers to other mutual funds not within the X Financial Technologies Investments fund complex (&#8220;other funds&#8221;), which may be managed in a style substantially similar to that of a U.S.
      registered XFT or XFT fund. Such other funds are not subject to the Fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings release policy. The sponsors of such funds may disclose the portfolio holdings of such funds at different times than the Fund discloses its
      portfolio holdings.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">In addition, some F-T Managers also serve as investment managers to separate accounts, which are subject to the Fund&#8217;s policy with respect to the release of the separate account&#8217;s holdings to consultants and potential
      clients. Separate accounts that are not, in the aggregate, substantially similar to the holdings of a U.S. registered XFT or XFT fund, however, are not subject to the restrictions imposed by the policy.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund&#8217;s portfolio holdings release policy and all subsequent amendments have been reviewed and approved by the Fund&#8217;s board, and any other material amendments shall also be reviewed and approved by the board. The
      investment manager&#8217;s compliance staff conducts periodic reviews of compliance with the policy and provides at least annually a report to the board regarding the operation of the policy and any material changes recommended as a result of such review.
      The investment manager&#8217;s compliance staff also will supply the board yearly with a list of exceptions granted to the policy, along with an explanation of the legitimate business purpose of the Fund that is served as a result of the exception.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">X Financial Technologies Trust (Trust) has a board of trustees. Each trustee will serve until that person resigns and/or a successor is elected and qualified. The board is responsible for the overall management of the
        Trust, including general supervision and review of the Fund&#8217;s investment activities. The board, in turn, elects the officers of the Trust who are responsible for administering the Fund&#8217;s day-to-day operations. The board also monitors the Fund to
        ensure that no material conflicts exist among share classes (to the extent that more than one share class is offered by the Fund). While none are expected, the board will act appropriately to resolve any material conflict that may arise.</div>
      <div style="margin-right: 10.8pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The name, year of birth and address of the officers and board members, as well as their affiliations, positions held with the Trust, principal occupations during at least the past five years,

    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Independent board members are reimbursed for expenses incurred in connection with attending board meetings and such expenses are paid pro rata by each fund in X Financial Technologies Investments for which they serve as
      director or trustee. No officer or board member received any other compensation, including pension or retirement benefits, directly or indirectly from the Trust or other funds in X Financial Technologies Investments. Certain officers or board members who
      are shareholders of XFT Resources, Inc. (Resources) may be deemed to receive indirect remuneration by virtue of their participation, if any, in the fees paid to its subsidiaries.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Board members historically have followed a policy of having substantial investments in one or more of the X Financial Technologies funds, as is consistent with their individual financial goals. In February 1998, this policy
      was formalized through the adoption of a requirement that each board member invest one-third of fees received for serving as a director or trustee of a XFT fund (excluding committee fees) in shares of one or more XFT funds and one-third
      of fees received for serving as a director or trustee of a XFT fund (excluding committee fees) in shares of one or more XFT funds until the value of such investments equals or exceeds five times the annual retainer and regular board meeting
      fees paid to such board member. Investments in the name of family members or entities controlled by a board member constitute fund holdings of such board member for purposes of this policy, and a three-year phase-in period applies to such investment
      requirements for newly elected board members. In implementing such policy, a board member&#8217;s fund holdings existing on February 27, 1998, are valued as of such date with subsequent investments valued at cost.</div>

      meetings, through regular reports that have been developed by management, in consultation with the board and its counsel. These reports address certain investment, valuation and compliance matters. The board also may receive special written reports
      or presentations on a variety of risk issues, either upon the board&#8217;s request or upon the investment manager&#8217;s initiative. In addition, the Audit Committee of the board meets regularly with the investment manager&#8217;s internal audit group to review
      reports on their examinations of functions and processes within X Financial Technologies Investments that affect the Fund.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">With respect to investment risk, the board expects to receive regular written reports describing and analyzing the investment performance of the Fund. In addition, the portfolio managers of the Fund are expected to meet
      regularly with the board to discuss portfolio performance, including investment risk. To the extent that the Fund changes a particular investment strategy that could have a material impact on the Fund&#8217;s risk profile, the board generally expects to be
      consulted with respect to such change. To the extent that the Fund invests in certain complex securities, the board expects to receive periodic reports containing information about exposure of the Fund to such instruments. In addition, the investment
      manager&#8217;s investment risk personnel are expected to meet regularly with the board to discuss a variety of issues, including the impact on the Fund of the investment in particular securities or instruments.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">With respect to valuation, the Fund&#8217;s administrator is expected to provide regular written reports to the board that enable the board to monitor the number of fair valued securities in a particular portfolio, the
      reasons for the fair valuation and the methodology used to arrive at the fair value. Such reports also are expected to include information concerning illiquid securities within the Fund&#8217;s portfolio. The board also expects to review dispositional
      analysis information on the sale of securities that require special valuation considerations such as illiquid or fair valued securities. In addition, the Fund&#8217;s Audit Committee reviews valuation procedures and results with the Fund&#8217;s auditors in
      connection with such Committee&#8217;s review of the results of the audit of the Fund&#8217;s year-end financial statements.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">With respect to compliance risks, the board expects to receive regular compliance reports prepared by the investment manager&#8217;s compliance group and meet regularly with the Fund&#8217;s Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) to
      discuss compliance issues, including compliance risks. In accordance with SEC rules, the independent board members meet regularly in executive session with the CCO, and the Fund&#8217;s CCO prepares and presents an annual written compliance report to the
      board. The Fund&#8217;s board adopts compliance policies and procedures for the Fund and approves such procedures for the Fund&#8217;s service providers. The compliance policies and procedures are specifically designed to detect and prevent violations of the

      with the Fund&#8217;s management or otherwise as provided under the 1940 Act. While the Chairman of the Board is an interested person, the board is also served by a lead independent board member. The lead independent board member, together with independent
      counsel, reviews proposed agendas for board meetings and generally acts as a liaison with management with respect to questions and issues raised by the independent board members. The lead independent board member also presides at separate meetings of
      independent board members held in advance of each scheduled board meeting where various matters, including those being considered at such board meeting are discussed. It is believed such structure and activities assure that proper consideration is
      given at board meetings to matters deemed important to the Fund and its shareholders.</div>

      years and beyond. In addition to personal qualities, such as integrity, the role of an effective Fund board member inherently requires the ability to comprehend, discuss and critically analyze materials and issues presented in exercising judgments
      and reaching informed conclusions relevant to his or her duties and fiduciary obligations. The board believes that the specific background of each board member evidences such ability and is appropriate to his or her serving on the Fund&#8217;s board. As

      publicly owned company engaged in the financial services industry through its subsidiaries. Charles B. Johnson (former Chairman and Director of Resources) and Rupert H. Johnson, Jr. are the principal shareholders of Resources.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The investment manager provides investment research and portfolio management services, and selects the securities for the Fund to buy, hold or sell. The investment manager also selects the brokers who execute the Fund&#8217;s
      portfolio transactions. The investment manager provides periodic reports to the board, which reviews and supervises the investment manager&#8217;s investment activities. To protect the Fund, the investment manager and its officers, directors and employees
      are covered by fidelity insurance.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The investment manager and its affiliates manage numerous other investment companies and accounts. The investment manager may give advice and take action with respect to any of the other funds it manages, or for its own
      account, that may differ from action taken by the investment manager on behalf of the Fund. Similarly, with respect to the Fund, the investment manager is not obligated to recommend, buy or sell, or to refrain from recommending, buying or selling any
      security that the investment manager and access persons, as defined by applicable federal securities laws, may buy or sell for its or their own account or for the accounts of any other fund. The investment manager is not obligated to refrain from
      investing in securities held by the Fund or other funds it manages.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund, its investment manager and the Fund&#8217;s principal underwriter have each adopted a code of ethics, as required by federal securities laws. Under the code of ethics, employees who are designated as access persons
      may engage in personal securities transactions, including transactions involving securities that are being considered for the Fund or that are currently held by the Fund, subject to certain general restrictions and procedures. The personal securities
      transactions of access persons of the Fund, its investment manager and the Fund&#8217;s principal underwriter will be governed by the code of ethics. The code of ethics is on file with, and available from, the SEC.</div>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Investor Services receives a fee for servicing Fund shareholder accounts. The Fund also will reimburse Investor Services for certain out-of-pocket expenses necessarily incurred in servicing the shareholder accounts in
      accordance with the terms of its servicing contract with the Fund.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Blockchain Administrator.</font>&#160; [ ], a Delaware limited liability company, is expected to be retained as the blockchain administrator (Blockchain Administrator) of the Fund, and will
      serve in such role pursuant to a master software as a service (&#8220;SAAS&#8221;) agreement and SAAS statement of work (collectively, the &#8220;Blockchain Administration Agreement&#8221;) to be entered into by and between the Trust on the Fund&#8217;s behalf and the Blockchain
      Administrator.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The services to be provided by the Blockchain Administrator will include technical and administrative functions in connection with the issuance and &#8220;permissioning&#8221; of the shares for the Fund on the blockchain (<font style="font-style: italic;">e.g., </font>limiting the parties who can transact on the blockchain), as well as reporting services relating to the Fund and shareholders. The Blockchain Administrator will work with Investor Services to record share
      issuance and redemption on the Stellar ledger.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Blockchain Administrator will also be responsible for the creation and maintenance of the App. The fees payable to the Blockchain Administrator are based on its standard schedule of fees charged by the Blockchain
      Administrator for similar services, as set forth in the Blockchain Administration Agreement. The Blockchain Administrator will be responsible for any network fees paid to the Stellar network in connection with the issuance and redemption of shares as

    <div>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 10pt; font-weight: bold;">Portfolio Transactions</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Since most purchases by the Fund are principal transactions at net prices, the Fund incurs little or no brokerage costs. The Fund deals directly with the selling or buying principal or market maker without incurring
      charges for the services of a broker on its behalf, unless it is determined that a better price or execution may be obtained by using the services of a broker. Purchases of portfolio securities from underwriters will include a commission or
      concession paid to the underwriter, and purchases from dealers will include a spread between the bid and ask price. The Fund seeks to obtain prompt execution of orders at the most favorable net price. Transactions may be directed to dealers in return
      for research and statistical information, as well as for special services provided by the dealers in the execution of orders.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">It is not possible to place an accurate dollar value on the special execution or on the research services the investment manager receives from dealers effecting transactions in portfolio securities. The allocation of
      transactions to obtain additional research services allows the investment manager to supplement its own research and analysis activities and to receive the views and information of individuals and research staffs from many securities firms. The
      receipt of these products and services does not reduce the investment manager&#8217;s research activities in providing investment advice to the Fund.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">As long as it is lawful and appropriate to do so, the investment manager and its affiliates may use this research and data in their investment advisory capacities with other clients.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">If purchases or sales of securities of the Fund and one or more other investment companies or clients supervised by the investment manager are considered at or about the same time, transactions in these securities will

      <div style="margin-bottom: 10pt; font-weight: bold;">Distributions and Taxes</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The following discussion is a summary of certain additional tax considerations generally affecting the Fund and its shareholders, some of which may not be described in the Fund&#8217;s prospectus. No attempt is made to
      present a complete detailed explanation of the tax treatment of the Fund or its shareholders. The discussions here and in the prospectus are not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The following discussion is based on the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), and applicable regulations in effect on the date of this SAI, including any amendments to the Code resulting from 2017
      legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Future legislative, regulatory or administrative changes, including any provisions of law that sunset and thereafter no longer apply, or court decisions may significantly change the tax rules
      applicable to the Fund and its shareholders. Any of these changes or court decisions may have a retroactive effect. Where indicated below, IRS refers to the United States Internal Revenue Service.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">This is for general information only and not tax advice. All investors should consult their own tax advisors as to the federal, state, local and foreign tax provisions applicable
      to them.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Distributions</font>&#160; The Fund intends to declare income dividends from its net investment income each day that its net asset value is calculated and pay them monthly. Capital gains, if
      any, may be paid at least annually. The Fund may distribute income dividends and capital gains more frequently, if necessary or appropriate in the board&#8217;s discretion. The amount of any distribution will vary, and there is no guarantee the Fund will
      pay either income dividends or capital gain distributions. Your income dividends and capital gain distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares at net asset value. Distributions declared in December to shareholders of record in
      such month and paid in January are taxable as if they were paid in December.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt; font-style: italic;">Distributions of net investment income.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund earns taxable income from many sources, including interest on domestic money market obligations, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements, and ordinary income from the sale of market discount bonds.
      This income, less expenses incurred in the operation of the Fund, constitutes the Fund&#8217;s net investment income from which dividends may be paid to you. The Fund does not pay &#8220;interest&#8221; to you. Any income dividends the Fund pays from this income will
      be taxable to you as ordinary income.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Distributions of capital gains. </font>The Fund may realize short-term capital gains and losses in connection with sales of its portfolio securities. Distributions of the Fund&#8217;s net
      short-term capital gains (if any) will be taxable to you as ordinary income. Net short-term capital gains will normally be included in ordinary income distributions only once a year, but may be included in these distributions more frequently to
      assist the Fund in maintaining a stable $1 offering price. Because the Fund is a money fund, it does not anticipate realizing any long-term capital gains on its investments.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Returns of capital. </font>If the Fund&#8217;s distributions exceed its earnings and profits (i.e., generally, it&#8217;s taxable income and realized capital gains) for a taxable year, all or a
      portion of the distributions made in that taxable year may be characterized as a return of capital to you. A return of capital distribution will generally not be taxable, but will reduce the cost basis in your Fund shares and will result in a higher
      capital gain or in a lower capital loss when you sell your shares. Any return of capital in excess of the basis in your Fund shares, however, will be taxable as a capital gain. In the case of a non-calendar year fund, earnings and profits are first
      allocated to distributions made on or before December 31 of its taxable year and then to distributions made thereafter. The effect of this provision is to &#8220;push&#8221; returns of capital into the next calendar year.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Undistributed capital gains. </font>The Fund may retain or distribute to shareholders its net capital gain for each taxable year. The Fund currently intends to distribute net capital
      gains. If the Fund elects to retain its net capital gain, the Fund will be taxed thereon (except to the extent of any available capital loss carryovers) at the applicable corporate tax rate. If the Fund elects to retain its net capital gain, it is
      expected that the Fund also will elect to have shareholders treated as if each received a distribution of its pro rata share of such gain, with the result that each shareholder will be required to report its pro rata share of such gain on its tax
      return as long-term capital gain, will receive a refundable tax credit for its pro rata share of tax paid</div>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Information on the amount and tax character of distributions</font>&#160; The Fund will inform you of the amount of your income dividends at the time they are paid, and will advise you of
      their tax status for federal income tax purposes shortly after the close of each calendar year.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Election to be taxed as a regulated investment company</font>&#160; The Fund has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Code. The Fund intends to
      qualify as a regulated investment company during the current fiscal year. As a regulated investment company, the Fund generally pays no federal income tax on the income and gains it distributes to you. In order to qualify for treatment as a regulated
      investment company, the Fund must satisfy the requirements described below.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Distribution requirement. </font>The Fund must distribute an amount equal to the sum of at least 90% of its investment company taxable income and 90% of its net tax-exempt income, if
      any, for the tax year (including, for purposes of satisfying this distribution requirement, certain distributions made by the Fund after the close of its taxable year that are treated as made during such taxable year).</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Income requirement. </font>The Fund must derive at least 90% of its gross income from dividends, interest, certain payments with respect to securities loans, and gains from the sale or
      other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, or other income (including, but not limited to, gains from options, futures or forward contracts) derived from its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies and net
      income derived from qualified publicly traded partnerships (QPTPs).</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Asset diversification test. </font>The Fund must satisfy the following asset diversification test at the close of each quarter of the Fund&#8217;s tax year: (1) at least 50% of the value of
      the Fund&#8217;s assets must consist of cash and cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other regulated investment companies, and securities of other issuers (as to which the Fund has not invested more than 5% of the value of the Fund&#8217;s
      total assets in securities of an issuer and as to which the Fund does not hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer); and (2) no more than 25% of the value of the Fund&#8217;s total assets may be invested in the securities of
      any one issuer (other than U.S. government securities or securities of other regulated investment companies) or of two or more issuers which the Fund controls and which are engaged in the same or similar trades or businesses, or, in the securities of
      one or more QPTPs.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">In some circumstances, the character and timing of income realized by the Fund for purposes of the income requirement or the identification of the issuer for purposes of the asset diversification test is uncertain under
      current law with respect to a particular investment, and an adverse determination or future guidance by the IRS with respect to such type of investment may adversely affect the Fund&#8217;s ability to satisfy these requirements. In other circumstances, the
      Fund may be required to sell portfolio holdings in order to meet the income requirement, distribution requirement, or asset diversification test, which may have a negative impact on the Fund&#8217;s income and performance. In lieu of potential
      disqualification, the Fund is permitted to pay a tax for certain failures to satisfy the asset diversification test or income requirement, which, in general, are limited to those due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">If for any taxable year the Fund does not qualify as a regulated investment company, all of its taxable income (including its net capital gain) would be subject to tax at the applicable corporate tax rate without any
      deduction for dividends paid to shareholders, and the dividends would be taxable to the shareholders as ordinary income (or possibly as qualified dividend income) to the extent of the Fund&#8217;s current and accumulated earnings and profits. Failure to
      qualify as a regulated investment company, subject to savings provisions for certain qualification failures, which, in general, are limited to those due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, would thus have a negative impact on the Fund&#8217;s
      income and performance. In that case, the Fund would be liable for federal, and possibly state, corporate taxes on its taxable income and gains, and distributions to you would be taxed as dividend income to the extent of the Fund&#8217;s earnings and
      profits. Even if such savings provisions apply, the Fund may be subject to a monetary sanction of $50,000 or more. Moreover, the board reserves the right not to maintain the qualification of the Fund as a regulated investment company if it determines
      such a course of action to be beneficial to shareholders.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Capital loss carryovers</font>&#160; The capital losses of the Fund, if any, do not flow through to shareholders. Rather, the Fund may use its capital losses, subject to applicable
      limitations, to offset its capital gains without being required to pay taxes on or distribute to shareholders such gains that are offset by the losses.</div>

      capital loss arising on the first day of the Fund&#8217;s next taxable year, and the excess (if any) of the Fund&#8217;s net long-term capital losses over its net short-term capital gains is treated as a long-term capital loss arising on the first day of the
      Fund&#8217;s next taxable year. Any such net capital losses of the Fund that are not used to offset capital gains may be carried forward indefinitely, subject to certain limitations, to reduce any future capital gains realized by the Fund in succeeding
      taxable years. Because the Fund is a money fund, it does not anticipate realizing any long-term capital losses.</div>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Tax reporting for income and excise tax years. </font>Because the periods for measuring a regulated investment company&#8217;s income are different for income (determined on a fiscal year
      basis) and excise tax years (determined as noted above), special rules are required to calculate the amount of income earned in each period, and the amount of earnings and profits needed to support that income. For example, if the Fund uses the
      excise tax period ending on October 31 as the measuring period for calculating and paying out capital gain net income and realizes a net capital loss between November 1 and the end of the Fund&#8217;s fiscal year, the Fund may calculate its earnings and
      profits without regard to such net capital loss in order to make its required distribution of capital gain net income for excise tax purposes. The Fund also may elect to treat part or all of any &#8220;qualified late year loss&#8221; as if it had been incurred
      in the succeeding taxable year in determining the Fund&#8217;s taxable income, net capital gain, net short-term capital gain, and earnings and profits. The effect of this election is to treat any such &#8220;qualified late year loss&#8221; as if it had been incurred
      in the succeeding taxable year, which may change the timing, amount, or characterization of Fund distributions.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">A &#8220;qualified late year loss&#8221; includes (i) any net capital loss incurred after October 31 of the current taxable year, or, if there is no such loss, any net long-term capital loss or any net short-term capital loss
      incurred after October 31 of the current taxable year (&#8220;post-October capital losses&#8221;), and (ii) the sum of (1) the excess, if any, of (a) specified losses incurred after October 31 of the current taxable year, over (b) specified gains incurred after
      October 31 of the current taxable year and (2) the excess, if any, of (a) ordinary losses incurred after December 31 of the current taxable year, over (b) the ordinary income incurred after December 31 of the current taxable year. The terms
      &#8220;specified losses&#8221; and &#8220;specified gains&#8221; mean ordinary losses and gains from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property (including the termination of a position with respect to such property) and foreign currency losses and gains. The terms
      &#8220;ordinary losses&#8221; and &#8220;ordinary income&#8221; mean other ordinary losses and income that are not described in the preceding sentence. The Fund may only elect to treat any post-October capital loss, specified gains and specified losses incurred after
      October 31 as if it had been incurred in the succeeding year in determining its taxable income for the current year.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Because these rules are not entirely clear, the Fund may be required to interpret the &#8220;qualified late-year loss&#8221; and other rules relating to these different year-ends to determine its taxable income and capital gains.
      The Fund&#8217;s reporting of income and its allocation between different taxable and excise tax years may be challenged by the IRS, possibly resulting in adjustments in the income reported by the Fund on its tax returns and/or by the Fund to you on your
      year-end tax statements.</div>

      case of an individual, the tax will be imposed on the lesser of (1) the shareholder&#8217;s net investment income or (2) the amount by which the shareholder&#8217;s modified adjusted gross income</div>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Qualified dividends and the corporate dividends-received deduction</font>&#160; Because the income of the Fund is primarily derived from investments earning interest rather than dividend

    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">U.S. government securities</font>&#160; The income earned on certain U.S. government obligations is generally exempt from state and local personal income taxes if earned directly by you.
      States also grant tax-free status to mutual fund dividends paid to you from interest earned on these obligations, subject in some states to minimum investment or reporting requirements that must be met by a fund. Distributions of ordinary income paid
      by the Fund to individual shareholders from interest earned on U.S. Government obligations may be exempt from state and local income taxation depending on the state. Shareholders should contact their tax advisors with respect to the state and local
      income tax consequences of investing in the Fund, including whether Fund dividends derived from interest on U.S. government obligations held by the Fund qualify for tax free treatment.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Investment in complex securities</font>&#160; The Fund may invest in securities issued or purchased at a discount that may require it to accrue and distribute income not yet received. In
      order to generate sufficient cash to make these distributions, the Fund may be required to sell securities in its portfolio that it otherwise might have continued to hold. These rules could affect the amount, timing and tax character of income
      distributed by the Fund to you.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">State income taxes</font>&#160; Some state tax codes adopt the Code through a certain date. As a result, such conforming states may not have adopted the version of the Code as amended by

      other basis of tax that differs from the Code.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The tax information furnished by the Fund to shareholders and the IRS annually with respect to the amount and character of dividends paid by the Fund will be prepared on the basis of current federal income tax law to
      comply with the information reporting requirements of the Code and not necessarily on the basis of the law of any state in which a shareholder is resident or otherwise subject to tax. Under the current California Revenue and Taxation Code, certain
      funds are required to report tax information to the California Franchise Tax Board annually.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Accordingly, the amount and character of income for state income tax purposes may differ from that for federal income tax purposes. X Financial Technologies Investments provides additional tax information through the App or
      online at XFTXFT.com (under the Tax Center) to assist shareholders with the preparation of their federal and state income tax returns. Shareholders are solely responsible for determining the amount and character of income to report on

      which case you may be required to file a nonresident U.S. income tax return.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">U.S. estate tax. </font>An individual who is a non-U.S. investor will be subject to U.S. federal estate tax on the value of the Fund shares owned at the time of death, unless a treaty
      exemption applies between the country of residence of the non-U.S. investor and the U.S. Even if a treaty exemption is available, a decedent&#8217;s estate may nevertheless be required to file a U.S. estate tax return to claim the exemption, as well as to
      obtain a U.S. federal transfer certificate. The transfer certificate will identify the property (i.e., Fund shares) on which a U.S. federal tax lien has been released and is required before the Fund can release a nonresident alien decedent&#8217;s
      investment in the Fund to his or her estate. A transfer certificate is not required for property administered by an executor or administrator appointed, qualified and acting within the United States. For estates with U.S. situs assets of not more
      than $60,000 (there is a statutory estate tax credit for this amount of property), an affidavit from the executor of the estate or other authorized individual along with additional evidence requested by the IRS relating to the decedent&#8217;s estate
      evidencing the U.S. situs assets may be provided in lieu of a federal transfer certificate. Transfers by gift of shares of the Fund by a non-U.S. investor who is a nonresident alien individual will not be subject to U.S. federal gift tax. The tax
      consequences to a non-U.S. investor entitled to claim the benefits of a treaty between the country of residence of the non-U.S. investor and the U.S. may be different from the consequences described above.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Tax certification and backup withholding as applied to non-U.S. investors. </font>Non-U.S. investors have special U.S. tax certification requirements to avoid backup withholding at a
      rate of 24% and, if applicable, to obtain the benefit of any income tax treaty between the non-U.S. investor&#8217;s country of residence and the United States. To claim these tax benefits, the non-U.S. investor must provide a properly completed Form
      W-8BEN (or other Form W-8, where applicable) to establish his or her status as a non-U.S. investor, to claim beneficial ownership over the assets in the account, and to claim, if applicable, a reduced rate of or exemption from withholding tax under
      the applicable treaty. A Form W-8BEN generally remains in effect for a period of three years beginning on the date that it is signed and ending on the last day of the third succeeding calendar year. In certain instances, Form W-8BEN may remain valid
      indefinitely unless the investor has a change of circumstances that renders the form incorrect and necessitates a new form and tax certification. Non-U.S. investors must advise the Fund of any change of circumstances that would render the information
      given on the form incorrect and must then provide a new W-8BEN to avoid the prospective application of backup withholding.</div>

      comply with the terms of an IGA and applicable local law instead of U.S. Treasury regulations.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">An FFI can avoid FATCA withholding if it is deemed compliant or by becoming a &#8220;participating FFI,&#8221; which requires the FFI to enter into a U.S. tax compliance agreement with the IRS under section 1471(b) of the Code (FFI
      agreement) under which it agrees to verify, report and disclose certain of its U.S. accountholders and provided that such entity meets certain other specified requirements. The FFI will report to the IRS, or, depending on the FFI&#8217;s country of
      residence, to the government of that country (pursuant to the terms and conditions of an applicable IGA and applicable law), which will, in turn, report to the IRS. An FFI that is resident in a country that has entered into an IGA with the U.S. to
      implement FATCA will be exempt from FATCA withholding provided that the FFI shareholder and the applicable foreign government comply with the terms of such agreement.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">An NFFE that is the beneficial owner of a payment from the Fund can avoid the FATCA withholding tax generally by certifying that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or by providing the name, address and
      taxpayer identification number of each substantial U.S. owner. The NFFE will report information either (i) to the Fund, or other applicable withholding agent, which will, in turn, report information to the IRS, or (ii) directly to the IRS.</div>

      the Fund will need to provide the Fund with documentation properly certifying the entity&#8217;s status under FATCA in order to avoid FATCA withholding. The requirements imposed by FATCA are different from, and in addition to, the U.S. tax certification
      rules to avoid backup withholding described above.</div>

      <div style="margin-bottom: 10pt; font-weight: bold;">Organization, Voting Rights and Principal Holders</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund is a diversified, open-end management investment company, commonly called a mutual fund.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Trust was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on August 2, 2019, and is registered with the SEC.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund currently offers one class of shares. The Fund may offer additional classes of shares in the future.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Trust has noncumulative voting rights. For board member elections, this gives holders of more than 50% of the shares voting the ability to elect all of the members of the board. If this happens, holders of the
      remaining shares voting will not be able to elect anyone to the board.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Trust does not intend to hold annual shareholder meetings. The Fund may hold special meetings, however, for matters requiring shareholder approval.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">As of the date of this SAI, the Fund does not have any shareholders.</div>
    <div>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 10pt; font-weight: bold;">Buying and Selling Shares</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund continuously offers its shares through X Financial Technologies Distributors, Inc. (Distributors). You may purchase or redeem shares of the Fund at any time through the App, although purchases and redemptions of Fund
      shares will only be processed during normal business hours on business days. The App is available for download through the Apple App Store and Google Play.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund and other U.S. registered investment companies within the X Financial Technologies Investments fund complex are intended for sale to residents of the U.S., and, with very limited exceptions, are not registered or
      otherwise offered for sale in other jurisdictions. The above restrictions are generally not applicable to sales in U.S. territories or to diplomatic staff members or members of the U.S. military with an APO or FPO address outside of the U.S.
      Investors are responsible for compliance with tax, securities, currency exchange or other regulations applicable to redemption and purchase transactions in any state or jurisdiction to which they may be subject. Investors should consult with
      appropriate tax and legal advisors to obtain information on the rules applicable to these transactions.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">In particular, the Fund is not registered in any provincial or territorial jurisdiction in Canada, and</div>

    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><br>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">shares of the Fund have not been qualified for sale in any Canadian jurisdiction. Shares of the Fund may not be directly or indirectly offered or sold in any provincial or territorial jurisdiction in Canada or to or for
      the benefit of residents thereof. Prospective investors may be required to declare that they are not Canadian residents and are not acquiring shares on behalf of any Canadian residents. If an investor becomes a Canadian resident after purchasing
      shares of the Fund, the investor will not be able to purchase any additional shares of the Fund (other than reinvestment of dividends and capital gains) or exchange shares of the Fund for other U.S. registered X Financial Technologies funds.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Similarly, the Fund is not registered, and shares of the Fund have not been qualified for distribution, in any member country of the European Union (EU) or European Economic Area (EEA). The shares offered by this
      prospectus may not be directly or indirectly offered or distributed in any such country. If an investor becomes an EU or EEA resident after purchasing shares of the Fund, the investor will not be able to purchase any additional shares of the Fund
      (other than reinvestment of dividends and capital gains) or exchange shares of the Fund for other U.S. registered X Financial Technologies funds.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">All electronic funds transfers (ACH) used to buy or sell shares of the Fund must be denominated in U.S. dollars and drawn on a U.S. bank. We may, in our sole discretion, either (a) reject any order to buy or sell shares
      denominated in any other currency or (b) honor the transaction or make adjustments to your account for the transaction as of a date and with a foreign currency exchange factor determined by the drawee bank. We may deduct any applicable banking
      charges imposed by the bank from your account.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Investment by large shareholders</font>&#160; Particularly during times of overall market turmoil or price volatility, the Fund may experience adverse effects when certain large shareholders
      such as institutional investors (including those trading by use of non-discretionary mathematical formulas) purchase or redeem large amounts of shares of the Fund. Such large shareholder redemptions may cause the Fund to sell portfolio securities at
      times when it would not otherwise do so. Similarly, large Fund share purchases may adversely affect the Fund&#8217;s performance to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash and is required to maintain a larger cash position than it
      ordinarily would.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">These transactions may also accelerate the realization of taxable income to shareholders if such sales of investments resulted in gains, and may also increase transaction costs. In addition, a large redemption could
      result in the Fund&#8217;s current expenses being allocated over a smaller asset base, leading to an increase in the Fund&#8217;s expense ratio.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">When experiencing such purchases and redemptions by large shareholders, the Fund may restrict or reject trading activity in accordance with the Frequent Trading Policy of the Fund as set forth in the Fund&#8217;s Prospectus.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">No Exchange privilege</font>&#160; Shares of the Fund may not be exchanges for shares of any other X Financial Technologies fund.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Redemptions in kind</font>&#160; The board reserves the right to make payments in whole or in part in securities or other assets of the Fund, in case of an emergency, or if the payment of
      such a redemption in cash would be detrimental to the existing shareholders of the Fund. In these circumstances, the securities distributed would be valued at the price used to compute the Fund&#8217;s net assets and you may incur brokerage fees in
      converting the securities to cash.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Share certificates</font>&#160; We will credit your shares to your Fund account through the App and we do not issue share certificates. This eliminates the costly problem of replacing lost,
      stolen or destroyed certificates.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">All purchases of Fund shares will be credited to you, in full and fractional Fund shares (rounded to the nearest 1/100 of a share), in an account maintained for you by the Fund&#8217;s transfer agent.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt; font-weight: bold;">General information</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">In most cases, if mail is returned as undeliverable we are required to take certain steps to try to find you free of charge. If these attempts are unsuccessful, however, we may deduct the costs of any additional efforts
      to find you from your account. These costs may include a percentage of the account when a search company charges a percentage fee in exchange for its location services.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Redemption proceeds shall be sent to you by electronic funds transfer (ACH). Neither the Fund nor its agents shall be liable to you or any other person if, for any reason, a redemption request by ACH is not processed as
      described in the prospectus.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Investor Services may charge you separate fees, negotiated directly with you, for providing special services in connection with your account. Fees for special services will not increase the Fund&#8217;s expenses.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">In the event of disputes involving conflicting claims of ownership or authority to control your shares, the Fund has the right (but has no obligation) to: (i) restrict the shares and require the written agreement</div>

      with a court of competent jurisdiction.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Should the Fund be required to defend against joint or multiple shareholders in any action relating to an ownership dispute, you expressly grant the Fund the right to obtain reimbursement for costs and expenses
      including, but not limited to, attorneys&#8217; fees and court costs, by unilaterally redeeming shares from your account.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund or its transfer agent may be required (i) pursuant to a validly issued levy, garnishment or other form of legal process, to sell your shares and remit the proceeds to a levying officer or other recipient; or
      (ii) pursuant to a final order of forfeiture or other form of legal process, to sell your shares and remit the proceeds to the U.S. or state government as directed.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">As long as we or our agents follow reasonable security procedures and act on instructions we or our agents reasonably believe are genuine, we and our agents will not be responsible for any losses that may occur from
      unauthorized requests in any form (written, telephone, or online). We will investigate any unauthorized request that you report to us and we will ask you to cooperate with us in the investigation, which may require you to file a police report and
      complete a notarized affidavit regarding the unauthorized request. We will assist in the claims process, on your behalf, with other financial institutions regarding the unauthorized request.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Using good faith efforts, the investment manager attempts to identify class action litigation settlements and regulatory or governmental recovery funds involving securities presently or formerly held by the Fund or
      issuers of such securities or related parties (Claims) in which the Fund may be eligible to participate. When such Claims are identified, the investment manager will cause the Fund to file proofs of claim. Currently, such Claim opportunities
      predominate in the U.S. and in Canada; the investment manager&#8217;s efforts are therefore focused on Claim opportunities in those jurisdictions. The investment manager may learn of such class action lawsuit or victim fund recovery opportunities in
      jurisdictions outside of North America (Foreign Actions), in which case the investment manager has complete discretion to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether to cause the Fund to file proofs of claim in such Foreign Actions. In addition, the
      investment manager may participate in bankruptcy proceedings relating to securities held by the Fund and join creditors&#8217; committees on behalf of the Fund.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Further, the investment manager may on occasion initiate and/or recommend, and the board of trustees of the Fund may approve, pursuit of separate litigation against an issuer or related parties in connection with
      securities presently or formerly held by the Fund (whether by opting out of an existing class action lawsuit or otherwise).</div>
    <div>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 10pt; font-weight: bold;">Pricing Shares</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The valuation of the Fund&#8217;s portfolio securities, including any securities set aside on the Fund&#8217;s books for when-issued securities, is based on the amortized cost of the securities, which does not take into account
      unrealized capital gains or losses. This method involves valuing an instrument at its cost and thereafter assuming a constant amortization to maturity of any discount or premium, regardless of the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the market
      value of the instrument. While this method provides certainty in calculation, it may result in periods during which value, as determined by amortized cost, is higher or lower than the price the Fund would receive if it sold the instrument. During
      periods of declining interest rates, the daily yield on shares of the Fund computed as described above may tend to be higher than a like computation made by a fund with identical investments but using a method of valuation based upon market prices
      and estimates of market prices for all of its portfolio instruments. Thus, if the use of amortized cost by the Fund resulted in a lower aggregate portfolio value on a particular day, a prospective investor in the Fund would be able to obtain a
      somewhat higher yield than would result from an investment in a fund using only market values, and existing investors in the Fund would receive less investment income. The opposite would be true in a period of rising interest rates. The Fund&#8217;s use of
      amortized cost, which helps the Fund maintain a $1.00 share price, is permitted by a rule adopted by the SEC.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The board has established procedures designed to stabilize, to the extent reasonably possible, the Fund&#8217;s price per share at $1.00, as computed for the purpose of sales and redemptions. These procedures include a review
      of the Fund&#8217;s holdings by the board, at such intervals as it may deem appropriate, to determine if the Fund&#8217;s net asset value calculated by using available market quotations deviates from $1.00 per share based on amortized cost. The extent of any
      deviation will be examined by the board. If a deviation exceeds <sup style="vertical-align: text-top; line-height: 1; font-size: smaller;">1</sup>/<sub style="vertical-align: bottom; line-height: 1; font-size: smaller;">2</sub> of 1%, the board will promptly consider what action, if any, will be initiated.

      which may include selling portfolio instruments before maturity to realize capital gains or losses or to shorten average portfolio maturity, withholding dividends, redeeming shares in kind, or establishing a net asset value per share by using
      available market quotations.</div>
    <div>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 10pt; font-weight: bold;">The Underwriter</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">X Financial Technologies Distributors, Inc. (Distributors) acts as the principal underwriter in the continuous public offering of the Fund&#8217;s shares. Distributors is located at One XFT Parkway, San Mateo, CA 94403-1906.</div>
    <div>
      <div style="margin-bottom: 10pt; font-weight: bold;">Performance</div>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Performance quotations are subject to SEC rules. These rules require the use of standardized performance quotations or, alternatively, that every non-standardized performance quotation furnished by the Fund be
      accompanied by certain standardized performance information computed as required by the SEC. Average annual total return, current yield and effective yield quotations used by the Fund are based on the standardized methods of computing performance
      mandated by the SEC. An explanation of these and other methods used by the Fund to compute or express performance follows. Regardless of the method used, past performance does not guarantee future results, and is an indication of the return to
      shareholders only for the limited historical period used.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Average annual total return</font>&#160; Average annual total return is determined by finding the average annual rates of return over certain periods that would equate an initial hypothetical
      $1,000 investment to its ending redeemable value. The calculation assumes income dividends are reinvested at net asset value. The quotation assumes the account was completely redeemed at the end of each period and the deduction of all applicable
      charges and fees.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The following SEC formula is used to calculate these figures:</div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">P(1 +T)<sup style="vertical-align: text-top; line-height: 1; font-size: smaller;">n</sup> = ERV</div>
    <div>where:</div>
    <div>P = a hypothetical initial payment of $1,000</div>
    <div>T = average annual total return</div>
    <div>n = number of years</div>
    <div style="text-indent: -28.8pt; margin-right: 3.6pt; margin-left: 28.8pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;">ERV = ending redeemable value of a hypothetical $1,000 payment made at the beginning of each period at the end of each period</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Current yield</font>&#160; Current yield shows the income per share earned by the Fund. It is calculated by determining the net change, excluding capital changes, in the value of a
      hypothetical pre-existing account with a balance of one share at the beginning of the period, subtracting a hypothetical charge reflecting deductions from shareholder accounts, and dividing the difference by the value of the account at the beginning
      of the base period to obtain the base period return. The result is then annualized by multiplying the base period return by 365/7.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Effective yield</font>&#160; The Fund&#8217;s effective yield is calculated in the same manner as its current yield, except the annualization of the return for the seven day period reflects the
      results of compounding.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The following SEC formula is used to calculate these figures:</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Effective yield = [(Base period return + 1)365/7] -1</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;"><font style="font-weight: bold;">Other performance quotations</font>&#160; The Fund may include in its advertising or sales material information relating to investment goals and performance results of funds belonging to

    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund may help you achieve various investment goals such as accumulating money for retirement, saving for a down payment on a home, college costs and other long-term goals. The XFT College Savings Planner may
      help you in determining how much money must be invested on a monthly basis to have a projected amount available in the future to fund a child&#8217;s college education. (Projected college cost estimates are based upon current costs published by the College
      Board.) The XFT Retirement Savings Planner leads you through the steps to start a retirement savings program. Of course, an investment in the Fund cannot guarantee that these goals will be met.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Fund is a member of X Financial Technologies Investments, one of the largest mutual fund organizations in the U.S., and may be considered in a program for diversification of assets. Founded in 1947, XFT is one of the

    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt; font-weight: bold;">Corporate Obligation Ratings</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt; font-style: italic;">Moody&#8217;s</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">INVESTMENT GRADE</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Aaa: Bonds rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, with minimal credit risk.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Aa: Bonds rated Aa are judged to be high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">A: Bonds rated A are considered upper medium-grade obligations and are subject to low credit risk.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Baa: Bonds rated Baa are subject to moderate credit risk and are considered medium-grade obligations. As such they may have certain speculative characteristics.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Ba: Bonds rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">B: Bonds rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Caa: Bonds rated Caa are judged to be of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Ca: Bonds rated Ca are considered highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some prospect of recovery of principal and interest.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">C: Bonds rated C are the lowest rated class of bonds and are typically in default. They have little prospects for recovery of principal or interest.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Note: Moody&#8217;s appends numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3 to each generic rating classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category;
      modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of that generic rating category.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt; font-style: italic;">S&amp;P<sup style="vertical-align: text-top; line-height: 1; font-size: smaller;">&#174;</sup></div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">The issue rating definitions are expressions in terms of default risk. As such, they pertain to senior obligations of an entity. Junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations, to reflect the lower
      priority in bankruptcy. (Such differentiation applies when an entity has both senior and subordinated obligations, secured and unsecured obligations, or operating company and holding company obligations.) Accordingly, in the case of junior debt, the
      rating may not conform exactly with the category definition.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">INVESTMENT GRADE</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">AAA: This is the highest rating assigned by S&amp;P to a debt obligation. The obligor&#8217;s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">AA: Obligations rated AA differ from AAA issues only in a small degree. The obligor&#8217;s capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">A: Obligations rated A are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in the higher ratings categories. However, the obligor&#8217;s capacity to meet
      its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">BBB: Obligations rated BBB exhibit adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial
      commitment on the obligation.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">BB, B, CCC, CC, C: Obligations rated BB, B, CCC, CC and C are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. BB indicates the least degree of speculation and C the highest degree of speculation. While these
      obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">BB: An obligation rated BB is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to</div>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">B: An obligation rated B is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated BB, but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Adverse business, financial, or
      economic conditions will likely impair the obligor&#8217;s capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">CCC: An obligation rated CCC is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the
      event of adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">CC: An obligation rated CC is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">C: A subordinated debt or preferred stock obligation rated C is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment. The C rating may be used to cover a situation where a bankruptcy petition has been filed or similar action
      taken, but payments on this obligation are being continued. The C rating is also assigned to a preferred stock issue in arrears on dividends or sinking fund payments, but that is still making payments.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">D: Obligations rated D are in payment default. The D rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired, unless S&amp;P believes that
      such payments will be made during such grace period. The D rating is also used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Plus (+) or minus (-): The ratings from &#8220;AA&#8221; to &#8220;CCC&#8221; may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">r: This symbol is attached to the ratings of instruments with significant noncredit risks and highlights risks to principal or volatility of expected returns that are not addressed in the credit rating.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt; font-weight: bold;">Short-Term Debt Ratings</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt; font-style: italic;">Moody&#8217;s</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">Moody&#8217;s short-term debt ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to honor short-term financial obligations. Ratings may be assigned to issuers, short-term programs and to individual short-term debt instruments.
      These obligations generally have an original maturity not exceeding 13 months, unless explicitly noted. Moody&#8217;s employs the following designations to indicate the relative repayment capacity of rated issuers:</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">P-1 (Prime-1): Issuers (or supporting institutions) so rated have a superior ability to repay short-term debt obligations.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">P-2 (Prime-2): Issuers (or supporting institutions) so rated have a strong ability to repay short-term debt obligations.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">P-3 (Prime-3): Issuers (or supporting institutions) so rated have an acceptable ability to repay short-term debt obligations.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">NP: Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Not Prime do not fall within any of the Prime rating categories.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt; font-style: italic;">S&amp;P&#174;</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">S&amp;P&#8217;s ratings are a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation, a specific class of financial obligations, or a specific financial program. Short-term
      ratings are generally assigned to those obligations considered short-term in the relevant market. In the U.S., for example, that means obligations with an original maturity of no more than 365 days &#8212; including commercial paper. Short-term ratings are
      also used to indicate the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to put features on long-term obligations. The result is a dual rating, in which the short-term rating addresses the put feature, in addition to the usual long-term rating.</div>

      obligation is strong. Within this category, certain obligations are designated with a plus sign (+). This indicates that the obligor&#8217;s capacity to meet its financial commitment on these obligations is extremely strong.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">A-2:<font id="TRGRRTFtoHTMLTab" style="display: inline-block; text-indent: 0px; font-size: 1px; width: 36pt">&#160;</font>Issues carrying this designation are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in
      circumstances and economic conditions than obligations carrying the higher designations. However, the obligor&#8217;s capacity to meet its financial commitments on the obligation is satisfactory.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">A-3:<font id="TRGRRTFtoHTMLTab" style="display: inline-block; text-indent: 0px; font-size: 1px; width: 36pt">&#160;</font>Issues carrying this designation exhibit adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic
      conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</div>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 8pt;"><br>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">B: Issues carrying this designation are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. The obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. However, it faces major
      ongoing uncertainties which could lead to the obligor&#8217;s inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">C: Issues carrying this designation are currently vulnerable to nonpayment and are dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the
      obligation.</div>
    <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt;">D: Issues carrying this designation are in payment default. The D rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the due date even if the applicable grace period has not expired, unless S&amp;P
      believes that such payments will be made during such grace period. The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized.</div>

  <div style="margin-bottom: 6pt; font-weight: bold;">Item 30. Indemnification</div>
  <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The Agreement and Declaration of Trust (the &#8220;Declaration&#8221;) provides that any person who is or was a Trustee, officer, employee or other agent, including the underwriter, of such Trust shall be liable
    to the Trust and its shareholders only for (1) any act or omission that constitutes a bad faith violation of the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or (2) the person&#8217;s own willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or
    reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person (such conduct referred to herein as Disqualifying Conduct) and for nothing else.&#160; Except in these instances and to the fullest extent that limitations of liability of agents are
    permitted by the Delaware Statutory Trust Act (the &#8220;Delaware Act&#8221;), these Agents (as defined in the Declaration) shall not be responsible or liable for any act or omission of any other Agent of the Trust or any investment adviser or principal
    underwriter.&#160; Moreover, except and to the extent provided in these instances, none of these Agents, when acting in their respective capacity as such, shall be personally liable to any other person, other than such Trust or its shareholders, for any
    act, omission or obligation of the Trust or any trustee thereof.</div>
  <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 12pt;">The Trust shall indemnify, out of its property, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any of the persons who was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party to any Proceeding
    (as defined in the Declaration) because the person is or was an Agent of such Trust.&#160; These persons shall be indemnified against any Expenses (as defined in the Declaration), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably
    incurred in connection with the Proceeding if the person acted in good faith or, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful.&#160; The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
    conviction or plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent shall not in itself create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith or that the person had reasonable cause to believe that the person&#8217;s conduct was unlawful.&#160; There shall
    nonetheless be no indemnification for a person&#8217;s own Disqualifying Conduct.</div>
  <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 12pt;">Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, may be permitted to Trustees, officers and controlling persons of the Trust pursuant to the foregoing
    provisions, or otherwise, the Trust has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.&#160; In the event that a claim for
    indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Trust of expenses incurred or paid by a Trustee, officer or controlling person of the Trust in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such
    Trustee, officer or controlling person in connection with securities being registered, the Trust may be required, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, to submit to a court or appropriate
    jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.</div>
